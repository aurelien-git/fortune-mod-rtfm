if - "use" a Perl module if a condition holds (also can "no" a module)
The "if" module is used to conditionally load or unload another module.  The construct
will load MODULE only if CONDITION evaluates to true.  The above statement has no effect unless
"CONDITION" is true.  If the CONDITION does evaluate to true, then the above line has the same effect as:
The use of "=>" above provides necessary quoting of "MODULE".  If you don't use the fat comma (eg you

history - GNU History Library
Many  programs  read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU History library is able to keep track
of those lines, associate arbitrary data with each line, and utilize information from previous  lines  in
composing new ones.
HISTORY EXPANSION
The  history  library  supports a history expansion feature that is identical to the history expansion in

xzdec, lzmadec - Small .xz and .lzma decompressors
xzdec [option...]  [file...]
lzmadec [option...]  [file...]
xzdec is a liblzma-based decompression-only tool for .xz (and only .xz) files.  xzdec is intended to work
xz  --decompress  --stdout  (and  possibly  a  few  other commonly used options) to decompress .xz files.
lzmadec is identical to xzdec except that lzmadec supports .lzma files instead of .xz files.
To reduce the size of the executable, xzdec doesn't support multithreading or localization,  and  doesn't
read  options from XZ_DEFAULTS and XZ_OPT environment variables.  xzdec doesn't support displaying inter‐
process instead of displaying progress information.

mii-tool - view, manipulate media-independent interface status

--advertise=media,...]  [-F, --force=media] [-p, --phy=addr] interface ...
Most fast ethernet adapters use an MII to autonegotiate link speed and duplex setting.
Most  intelligent  network devices use an autonegotiation protocol to communicate what media technologies
they support, and then select the fastest mutually supported media technology.   The  -A  or  --advertise
options  can  be  used  to  tell  the  MII  to only advertise a subset of its capabilities.  Some passive
devices, such as single-speed hubs, are unable to autonegotiate.  To handle such devices, the MII  proto‐
-F or --force options can be used to force the MII to operate in one mode,  instead  of  autonegotiating.
The -A and -F options are mutually exclusive.

lsblk - list block devices
lsblk [options] [device...]
lsblk  lists information about all available or the specified block devices.  The lsblk command reads the
sysfs filesystem and udev db to gather information.
The command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a tree-like  format  by  default.   Use  lsblk
--help to get a list of all available columns.
The  default  output,  as well as the default output from options like --fs and --topology, is subject to
change.  So whenever possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.  Always explicitly
define expected columns by using --output columns-list in environments where a stable output is required.

logsave - save the output of a command in a logfile
logsave [ -asv ] logfile cmd_prog [ ... ]
The  logsave  program will execute cmd_prog with the specified argument(s), and save a copy of its output
to logfile.  If the containing directory for logfile does not exist, logsave will accumulate  the  output
in memory until it can be written out.  A copy of the output will also be written to standard output.
If  cmd_prog  is  a single hyphen ('-'), then instead of executing a program, logsave will take its input
from standard input and save it in logfile
logsave is useful for saving the output of initial boot scripts until the /var partition is  mounted,  so
the output can be written to /var/log.

routing  cache  statistics,  it  supports  any  kind of statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in
/proc/net/stat/.
Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column names.  These names  are  used  by
lnstat  as keys for selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line fol‐

lvmetad — LVM metadata cache daemon
lvmetad [-l level[,level...]]  [-p pidfile_path] [-s socket_path] [-t timeout_value] [-f] [-h] [-V] [-?]
The  lvmetad daemon caches LVM metadata so that LVM commands can read metadata from the cache rather than
the normal work of the system.  lvmetad can be a disadvantage when disk event notifications from the sys‐
tem are unreliable.
lvmetad does not read metadata from disks itself.  Instead, it relies on  an  LVM  command,  like  pvscan
--cache, to read metadata from disks and send it to lvmetad to be cached.
New LVM disks that appear on the system must be scanned before lvmetad knows about them.  If lvmetad does
not know about a disk, then LVM commands using lvmetad will also not know about it.  When disks are added
or removed from the system, lvmetad must be updated.

dnssec-settime reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the key timing metadata as specified by the -P,
-A, -R, -I, and -D options. The metadata can then be used by dnssec-signzone or other signing software to
determine when a key is to be published, whether it should be used for signing a zone, etc.

makepkg-template - package build templating utility

makepkg-template is a script to ease the work of maintaining multiple similar PKGBUILDs. It allows you to
move most of the code from the PKGBUILD into a template file and uses markers to allow in-place updating
of existing PKGBUILDs if the template has been changed.
Template files can contain any code allowed in a PKGBUILD. You can think of them like external files
included with "." or "source", but they will be inlined into the PKGBUILD by makepkg-template so you do
not depend on the template file when building the package.

depmod - Generate modules.dep and map files.

depmod [-e] [-E Module.symvers] [-F System.map] [-m] [-n] [-v] [-P prefix] [-w] [version] [filename...]
Linux kernel modules can provide services (called "symbols") for other modules to use (using one of the
EXPORT_SYMBOL variants in the code). If a second module uses this symbol, that second module clearly
depends on the first module. These dependencies can get quite complex.
depmod creates a list of module dependencies by reading each module under /lib/modules/version and
determining what symbols it exports and what symbols it needs. By default, this list is written to
modules.dep, and a binary hashed version named modules.dep.bin, in the same directory. If filenames are
given on the command line, only those modules are examined (which is rarely useful unless all modules are
listed).  depmod also creates a list of symbols provided by modules in the file named modules.symbols and

lscpu gathers CPU architecture information from sysfs, /proc/cpuinfo and any applicable architecture-spe‐
cific libraries (e.g. librtas on Powerpc).  The command output can be optimized for parsing or  for  easy
readability  by humans.  The information includes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads, cores, sock‐
ets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes.  There is also information  about  the  CPU  caches  and
cache sharing, family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.
In virtualized environments, the CPU architecture information displayed reflects the configuration of the
guest operating system which is typically different from the physical (host)  system.   On  architectures
that  support  retrieving physical topology information, lscpu also displays the number of physical sock‐
ets, chips, cores in the host system.

lnstat - unified linux network statistics
lnstat [options]
lnstat  is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old rtstat program. It is commonly
used to periodically print a selection of statistical values exported by  the  kernel.   In  addition  to
routing  cache  statistics,  it  supports  any  kind of statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in
/proc/net/stat/.
Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column names.  These names  are  used  by
lnstat  as keys for selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line fol‐
lows which lists the actual values for each column of the file. lnstat sums these  values  up  (which  in
fact  are  counters)  before printing them. After each interval, only the difference to the last value is

xzdec is a liblzma-based decompression-only tool for .xz (and only .xz) files.  xzdec is intended to work
xz  --decompress  --stdout  (and  possibly  a  few  other commonly used options) to decompress .xz files.
lzmadec is identical to xzdec except that lzmadec supports .lzma files instead of .xz files.
To reduce the size of the executable, xzdec doesn't support multithreading or localization,  and  doesn't
read  options from XZ_DEFAULTS and XZ_OPT environment variables.  xzdec doesn't support displaying inter‐

addftinfo - add information to troff font files for use with groff
addftinfo [ -v ] [ param-option value....  ] res unitwidth font
addftinfo  reads  a  troff font file and adds some additional font-metric information that is used by the
groff system.  The font file with the information added is written on the standard output.  The  informa‐
tion  added  is guessed using some parametric information about the font and assumptions about the tradi‐
tional troff names for characters.  The main information added is the heights and depths  of  characters.
The res and unitwidth arguments should be the same as the corresponding parameters in the DESC file; font
is the name of the file describing the font; if font ends with I the font will be assumed to be italic.
–v prints the version number.
All other options change one of the parameters that are used to derive the heights and depths.  Like  the

top - display Linux processes
top -hv|-bcHiOSs -d secs -n max -u|U user -p pid -o fld -w [cols]
The traditional switches `-' and whitespace are optional.
The  top  program  provides  a dynamic real-time view of a running system.  It can display system summary
information as well as a list of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux  kernel.   The
types of system summary information shown and the types, order and size of information displayed for pro‐
cesses are all user configurable and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.
The program provides a limited interactive interface for process manipulation as  well  as  a  much  more
extensive  interface  for  personal  configuration   --  encompassing every aspect of its operation.  And
while top is referred to throughout this document, you are free to name the program  anything  you  wish.
That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on top's display and used when reading and writ‐

bashbug - report a bug in bash
bashbug [--version] [--help] [email-address]
bashbug  is  a  shell  script to help the user compose and mail bug reports concerning bash in a standard
format.  bashbug invokes the editor specified by the environment variable EDITOR on a temporary  copy  of
the bug report format outline. The user must fill in the appropriate fields and exit the editor.  bashbug
then mails the completed report to bug-bash@gnu.org, or email-address.  If the report cannot  be  mailed,
it is saved in the file dead.bashbug in the invoking user's home directory.
The bug report format outline consists of several sections.  The first section provides information about
the machine, operating system, the bash version, and the compilation  environment.   The  second  section
should  be  filled in with a description of the bug.  The third section should be a description of how to
reproduce the bug.  The optional fourth section is for a proposed fix.  Fixes are encouraged.

watchgnupg - Read and print logs from a socket
watchgnupg [--force] [--verbose] socketname
Most  of  the main utilities are able to write their log files to a Unix Domain socket if configured that
way.  watchgnupg is a simple listener for such a socket.  It ameliorates the output with a time stamp and

[-u user] [VAR=value] [-i | -s] [command]
sudoedit [-AknS] [-a type] [-C num] [-c class] [-g group] [-h host] [-p prompt] [-u user] file ...
sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the
security policy.  The invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with
which to query the security policy.
sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging.  Third parties can
develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end.

Version comparison operates as follows:
%
xxd - make a hexdump or do the reverse.
xxd -h[elp]
xxd [options] [infile [outfile]]
xxd -r[evert] [options] [infile [outfile]]
xxd  creates  a  hex  dump of a given file or standard input.  It can also convert a hex dump back to its
`mail-safe' ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output.  Moreover, it can
be used to perform binary file patching.
If no infile is given, standard input is read.  If infile is specified as a `-' character, then input  is
taken from standard input.  If no outfile is given (or a `-' character is in its place), results are sent
to standard output.

fallocate - preallocate or deallocate space to a file
fallocate [-c|-p|-z] [-o offset] -l length [-n] filename
fallocate -d [-o offset] [-l length] filename
fallocate  is used to manipulate the allocated disk space for a file, either to deallocate or preallocate
it.  For filesystems which support the fallocate system call, preallocation is done quickly by allocating

lnstat  is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old rtstat program. It is commonly
used to periodically print a selection of statistical values exported by  the  kernel.   In  addition  to
routing  cache  statistics,  it  supports  any  kind of statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in
/proc/net/stat/.
Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column names.  These names  are  used  by
lnstat  as keys for selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line fol‐
lows which lists the actual values for each column of the file. lnstat sums these  values  up  (which  in
fact  are  counters)  before printing them. After each interval, only the difference to the last value is

dbus-cleanup-sockets - clean up leftover sockets in a directory
dbus-cleanup-sockets [DIRECTORY]
The dbus-cleanup-sockets command cleans up unused D-Bus connection sockets. See

If given no arguments, dbus-cleanup-sockets cleans up sockets in the standard default socket directory
for the per-user-login-session message bus; this is usually /tmp. Optionally, you can pass a different
directory on the command line.
On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because D-Bus defaults to using "abstract sockets" that
exist only in memory and don't have a corresponding file in /tmp.

sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...
Sed is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream

patible with Unix eqn.  The output of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff; it must  be  processed
with  GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line, the standard input is read.  A filename of -

the given files are uncompressed if necessary and fed to grep.
If the GREP environment variable is set, zgrep uses it as the grep program to be invoked.

lvreduce allows you to reduce the size of a logical volume.  Be careful when reducing a logical  volume's
size, because data in the reduced part is lost!!!
You  should therefore ensure that any filesystem on the volume is resized before running lvreduce so that
the extents that are to be removed are not in use.
Sizes  will be rounded if necessary - for example, the volume size must be an exact number of extents and
the size of a striped segment must be a multiple of the number of stripes.

dnssec-keymgr [-K directory] [-c file] [-f] [-k] [-q] [-v] [-z] [-g path] [-r path] [-s path] [zone...]
dnssec-keymgr is a high level Python wrapper to facilitate the key rollover process for zones handled by
BIND. It uses the BIND commands for manipulating DNSSEC key metadata: dnssec-keygen and dnssec-settime.
DNSSEC policy can be read from a configuration file (default /etc/dnssec-policy.conf), from which the key
parameters, publication and rollover schedule, and desired coverage duration for any given zone can be
default policy used for all zones.
When dnssec-keymgr runs, it examines the DNSSEC keys for one or more zones, comparing their timing
metadata against the policies for those zones. If key settings do not conform to the DNSSEC policy (for
example, because the policy has been changed), they are automatically corrected.

named-journalprint - print zone journal in human-readable form
named-journalprint {journal}
named-journalprint prints the contents of a zone journal file in a human-readable form.
Journal files are automatically created by named when changes are made to dynamic zones (e.g., by
nsupdate). They record each addition or deletion of a resource record, in binary format, allowing the
changes to be re-applied to the zone when the server is restarted after a shutdown or crash. By default,
the name of the journal file is formed by appending the extension .jnl to the name of the corresponding
zone file.
named-journalprint converts the contents of a given journal file into a human-readable text format. Each
line begins with "add" or "del", to indicate whether the record was added or deleted, and continues with
the resource record in master-file format.

netcat -l -p port [options] [hostname] [port] ...
netcat -L hostname:port -p port [options] ...
Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP
protocol.  It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by
other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration
tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-
in capabilities.  Netcat, or "nc" as the original program was named, should have been supplied long ago
as another one of those cryptic but standard Unix tools.

make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs
make [OPTION]... [TARGET]...
The  make utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and
issue the commands to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation  of  make,  which  was
written  by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples
show C programs, since they are very common, but you can use make with  any  programming  language  whose
compiler  can  be run with a shell command.  In fact, make is not limited to programs.  You can use it to
describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.
To prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships  among
files  in  your program, and the states the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the
executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.

bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language
bc [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [  file ... ]
bc  is  a  language  that  supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements.
There are some similarities in the syntax to the C programming language.   A  standard  math  library  is
available by command line option.  If requested, the math library is defined before processing any files.
bc starts by processing code from all the files listed on the command line in the  order  listed.   After
all  files  have  been  processed, bc reads from the standard input.  All code is executed as it is read.
(If a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)

taskset - set or retrieve a process's CPU affinity
taskset [options] mask command [argument...]
taskset [options] -p [mask] pid
taskset  is  used  to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a running process given its pid, or to launch a
new command with a given CPU affinity.  CPU affinity is a scheduler property that "bonds" a process to  a
given  set  of CPUs on the system.  The Linux scheduler will honor the given CPU affinity and the process
scheduler  attempts  to  keep  processes  on  the  same CPU as long as practical for performance reasons.
Therefore, forcing a specific CPU affinity is useful only in certain applications.
The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest order bit corresponding to the first  logi‐

xfs_metadump  is  a debugging tool that copies the metadata from an XFS filesystem to a file.  The source
argument must be the pathname of the device or file containing the XFS filesystem and the target argument
output to be redirected to another program such as a compression application.
xfs_metadump does not alter the source filesystem in any way. The target  image  is  a  contiguous  (non-

mkfs.btrfs is used to create the btrfs filesystem on a single or multiple devices. <device> is typically
a block device but can be a file-backed image as well. Multiple devices are grouped by UUID of the
filesystem.
Before mounting such filesystem, the kernel module must know all the devices either via preceding
execution of btrfs device scan or using the device mount option. See section MULTIPLE DEVICES for more
details.
%
runlevel - Print previous and current SysV runlevel
runlevel [options...]
"Runlevels" are an obsolete way to start and stop groups of services used in SysV init. systemd provides
a compatibility layer that maps runlevels to targets, and associated binaries like runlevel.
Nevertheless, only one runlevel can be "active" at a given time, while systemd can activate multiple
targets concurrently, so the mapping to runlevels is confusing and only approximate. Runlevels should not
be used in new code, and are mostly useful as a shorthand way to refer the matching systemd targets in
kernel boot parameters.

zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text
zless [ name ...  ]
Zless is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a

running less.  However, enough people seem to think that having the command zless available is  important
to be worth providing it.

There are two well-known message buses: the systemwide message bus (installed on many systems as the
"messagebus" service) and the per-user-login-session message bus (started each time a user logs in). The
--system and --session options direct dbus-send to send messages to the system or session buses
respectively. If neither is specified, dbus-send sends to the session bus.
Nearly all uses of dbus-send must provide the --dest argument which is the name of a connection on the
bus to send the message to. If --dest is omitted, no destination is set.

ldns-signzone - sign a zonefile with DNSSEC data
ldns-signzone  is used to generate a DNSSEC signed zone. When run it will create a new zonefile that con‐
Keys must be specified by their base name (i.e. without .private). If the DNSKEY that belongs to the  key
in  the  .private file is not present in the zone, it will be read from the file <base name>.key. If that
file does not exist, the DNSKEY value will be generated from the private key.
Multiple keys can be specified, Key Signing Keys are used as such when they are either already present in
the zone, or specified in a .key file, and have the KSK bit set.

Lesskey is used to specify a set of key bindings to be used by less.  The input file is a text file which
describes the key bindings.  If the input file is "-", standard input is read.  If no input file is spec‐
ified, a standard filename is used as the name of the input file, which depends on the system being used:
$HOME/lesskey.ini  is used, or $INIT/lesskey.ini if $HOME is undefined.  The output file is a binary file

cryptsetup - manage plain dm-crypt and LUKS encrypted volumes
cryptsetup <options> <action> <action args>
cryptsetup is used to conveniently setup dm-crypt managed device-mapper mappings. These include plain dm-
crypt volumes and LUKS volumes. The difference is that LUKS uses a metadata header and  can  hence  offer
more features than plain dm-crypt. On the other hand, the header is visible and vulnerable to damage.
In  addition,  cryptsetup  provides limited support for the use of historic loopaes volumes and for True‐
Crypt compatible volumes.
PLAIN DM-CRYPT OR LUKS?
Unless you understand the cryptographic background well, use LUKS.  With plain dm-crypt there are a  num‐
ber  of  possible  user  errors  that massively decrease security. While LUKS cannot fix them all, it can
lessen the impact for many of them.

catman - create or update the pre-formatted manual pages
catman [-d?V] [-M path] [-C file] [section] ...
catman  is  used to create an up to date set of pre-formatted manual pages known as cat pages.  Cat pages
are generally much faster to display than the original manual pages, but  require  extra  storage  space.
The  decision to support cat pages is that of the local administrator, who must provide suitable directo‐
ries to contain them.
The options available to catman are the manual page hierarchies and sections to pre-format.  The  default
hierarchies  are  those specified as system hierarchies in the man-db configuration file, and the default
sections are either the colon-delimited contents of the environment variable $MANSECT or the standard set
compiled  into man if $MANSECT is undefined.  Supplying catman with a set of whitespace-delimited section
names will override both of the above.

dnssec-coverage - checks future DNSKEY coverage for a zone
dnssec-coverage [-K directory] [-l length] [-f file] [-d DNSKEY TTL] [-m max TTL] [-r interval]

dnssec-coverage verifies that the DNSSEC keys for a given zone or a set of zones have timing metadata set
properly to ensure no future lapses in DNSSEC coverage.
If zone is specified, then keys found in the key repository matching that zone are scanned, and an
ordered list is generated of the events scheduled for that key (i.e., publication, activation,
inactivation, deletion). The list of events is walked in order of occurrence. Warnings are generated if
any event is scheduled which could cause the zone to enter a state in which validation failures might
occur: for example, if the number of published or active keys for a given algorithm drops to zero, or if
a key is deleted from the zone too soon after a new key is rolled, and cached data signed by the prior
key has not had time to expire from resolver caches.

bison - GNU Project parser generator (yacc replacement)
bison [OPTION]... FILE
designed for yacc.
Input files should follow the yacc convention of ending in .y.  Unlike yacc, the generated files  do  not
have fixed names, but instead use the prefix of the input file.  Moreover, if you need to put C++ code in
the input file, you can end his name by a C++-like extension (.ypp or .y++), then bison will follow  your
extension  to  name  the  output  file  (.cpp  or  .c++).  For instance, a grammar description file named
parse.yxx would produce the generated parser in a file named parse.tab.cxx, instead of yacc's y.tab.c  or
old Bison version's parse.tab.c.

stituent  files of the archives with the correct permissions and ownership, and then pack them up, or one
would have to construct the archives directly, without using the archiver.
simulate the effect the real library functions would have had, had the user really been root. These wrap‐
per functions are in a shared library /usr/lib/*/libfakeroot-*.so or similar location on  your  platform.

glib-genmarshal - C code marshaller generation utility for GLib closures
glib-genmarshal [OPTION...] [FILE...]
glib-genmarshal is a small utility that generates C code marshallers for callback functions of the
GClosure mechanism in the GObject sublibrary of GLib. The marshaller functions have a standard signature,
they get passed in the invoking closure, an array of value structures holding the callback function
parameters and a value structure for the return value of the callback. The marshaller is then responsible
to call the respective C code function of the closure with all the parameters on the stack and to collect
its return value.
glib-genmarshal takes a list of marshallers to generate as input. The marshaller list is either read from
standard input or from files passed as additional arguments on the command line.

kproplog [-h] [-e num] [-v] kproplog [-R]
The  kproplog command displays the contents of the KDC database update log to standard output.  It can be
used to keep track of incremental updates to the principal database.  The update log  file  contains  the
slave KDC servers.  When updates occur, they are logged to this file.  Subsequently any KDC slave config‐
ured  for incremental updates will request the current data from the master KDC and update their log file
with any updates returned.
The kproplog command requires read access to the update log file.  It will display  update  entries  only
for the KDC it runs on.
If  no  options  are specified, kproplog displays a summary of the update log.  If invoked on the master,

helper is thus called only when SELinux is enabled on the system.
The interface of the helper - command line options, and input/output data format are internal to the
pam_unix module and it should not be called directly from applications.
