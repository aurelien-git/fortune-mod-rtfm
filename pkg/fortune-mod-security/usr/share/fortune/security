       if - "use" a Perl module if a condition holds (also can "no" a module)
       The "if" module is used to conditionally load or unload another module.  The construct
       will load MODULE only if CONDITION evaluates to true.  The above statement has no effect unless "CONDITION" is true.  If the
       CONDITION does evaluate to true, then the above line has the same effect as:
       The use of "=>" above provides necessary quoting of "MODULE".  If you don't use the fat comma (eg you don't have any

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
       for - 'For' loop
       for start test next body
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
       For is a looping command, similar in structure to the C for statement.  The start, next, and body arguments must be Tcl com‐
       mand strings, and test is an expression string.  The for command first invokes the Tcl interpreter to execute  start.   Then
       it  repeatedly  evaluates  test  as  an  expression;  if the result is non-zero it invokes the Tcl interpreter on body, then
       invokes the Tcl interpreter on next, then repeats the loop.  The command terminates when test evaluates to 0.  If a continue
       command  is invoked within body then any remaining commands in the current execution of body are skipped; processing contin‐
       ues by invoking the Tcl interpreter on next, then evaluating test, and so on.  If a break command is invoked within body  or
       next,  then  the  for command will return immediately.  The operation of break and continue are similar to the corresponding
       statements in C.  For returns an empty string.

       The  while  command  evaluates  test  as an expression (in the same way that expr evaluates its argument).  The value of the
       expression must a proper boolean value; if it is a true value then body is executed by passing it to  the  Tcl  interpreter.
       Once body has been executed then test is evaluated again, and the process repeats until eventually test evaluates to a false
       boolean value.  Continue commands may be executed inside body to terminate the current iteration of the loop, and break com‐
       mands  may be executed inside body to cause immediate termination of the while command.  The while command always returns an
       empty string.

       time - time a simple command or give resource usage
       time [options] command [arguments...]
       The  time command runs the specified program command with the given arguments.  When command finishes, time writes a message
       to standard error giving timing statistics about this program run.  These statistics consist of (i) the  elapsed  real  time
       between  invocation  and termination, (ii) the user CPU time (the sum of the tms_utime and tms_cutime values in a struct tms

       module - command interface to the Modules package
       module [ switches ] [ sub-command ] [ sub-command-args ]
       module  is a user interface to the Modules package.  The Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of the user's
       environment via modulefiles.
       Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell for an application.   Once  the  Modules  package  is
       initialized,  the  environment  can be modified on a per-module basis using the module command which interprets modulefiles.
       Typically modulefiles instruct the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as  PATH,  MANPATH,  etc.
       modulefiles  may  be  shared  by many users on a system and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
       shared modulefiles.
       The modulefiles are added to and removed from the current environment by the user.  The environment changes contained  in  a
       modulefile  can  be summarized through the module command as well.  If no arguments are given, a summary of the module usage

       kill - terminate a process
       kill [-signal|-s signal|-p] [-q value] [-a] [--] pid|name...
       kill -l [number] | -L
       The  command  kill  sends the specified signal to the specified processes or process groups.  If no signal is specified, the
       TERM signal is sent.  This TERM signal will kill processes that do not catch it; for other processes it may be necessary  to
       use the KILL signal (number 9), since this signal cannot be caught.
       Most  modern  shells  have  a builtin kill function, with a usage rather similar to that of the command described here.  The
       --all, --pid, and --queue options, and the possibility to specify processes by command name, are local extensions.
       If signal is 0, then no actual signal is sent, but error checking is still performed.

       dirmngr-client - Tool to access the Dirmngr services
       dirmngr-client [options] [certfile|pattern]
       The  dirmngr-client is a simple tool to contact a running dirmngr and test whether a certificate has been revoked --- either
       by being listed in the corresponding CRL or by running the OCSP protocol.  If no dirmngr is running, a new instances will be
       started but this is in general not a good idea due to the huge performance overhead.
       The usual way to run this tool is either:

       In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR)
       followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix text files a line break is a single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text files,
       prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR) character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.

       sealert [-b] [-f local_id] [-h] [-s] [-S] [-l id] [-a file] [-u] [-p] [-P plugin_name]
       This manual page describes the sealert program.
       sealert is the user interface component (either GUI or command line) to the setroubleshoot system. setroubleshoot is used to
       diagnose SELinux denials and attempts to provide user friendly explanations for a SELinux denial (e.g. AVC) and  recommenda‐
       tions for how one might adjust the system to prevent the denial in the future.
       In a standard configuration setroubleshoot is composed of two components, setroubleshootd and sealert.
       setroubleshootd  is  a  system  daemon  which runs with root privileges and listens for audit events emitted from the kernel
       related to SELinux. The audit daemon must be running.  The audit daemon sends a dbus message to the  setroubleshootd  daemon
       when  the  system gets an SELinux AVC denial.  The setroubleshootd daemon then runs a series of analysis plugins which exam‐

       whereis - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command
       whereis [options] [-BMS directory... -f] name...
       whereis  locates the binary, source and manual files for the specified command names.  The supplied names are first stripped
       of leading pathname components and any (single) trailing extension of the  form  .ext  (for  example:  .c)  Prefixes  of  s.
       resulting  from  use of source code control are also dealt with.  whereis then attempts to locate the desired program in the
       standard Linux places, and in the places specified by $PATH and $MANPATH.
       The search restrictions (options -b, -m and -s) are cumulative and apply to the subsequent  name  patterns  on  the  command
       line.  Any new search restriction resets the search mask.  For example,
              whereis -bm ls tr -m gcc
       searches for "ls" and "tr" binaries and man pages, and for "gcc" man pages only.

       ranlib - generate index to archive.
       ranlib [--plugin name] [-DhHvVt] archive
       ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined
       by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.
       You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index.
       An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and allows routines in the library to call each other without
       regard to their placement in the archive.
       The GNU ranlib program is another form of GNU ar; running ranlib is completely equivalent to executing ar -s.

       gzexe - compress executable files in place

       The  gzexe  utility  allows you to compress executables in place and have them automatically uncompress and execute when you
       run them (at a penalty in performance).  For example if you execute ``gzexe /usr/bin/gdb'' it will create the following  two
       files:
       /usr/bin/gdb~ is the original file and /usr/bin/gdb is the self-uncompressing executable file.  You can remove /usr/bin/gdb~
       once you are sure that /usr/bin/gdb works properly.
       This utility is most useful on systems with very small disks.

       Run  the  cmd application within a tightly confined SELinux domain.  The default sandbox domain only allows applications the

       The update-desktop-database program is a tool to build a cache database of the MIME types handled by desktop files.
       The  cache  database contains the list of MIME types that can be handled by desktop files, as well as, for each MIME type, a

       psfxtable - handle Unicode character tables for console fonts
       psfxtable [-i infont] [-o outfont] [-it intable] [-ot outtable] [-nt]
       psfxtable  handles  the embedded Unicode character table for .psf format console fonts. It reads a font and possibly a table
       input  or  standard output is used.  If no -i option is given, the font is read from standard input.  If no -it or -o or -ot
       option is given, no input table is read or no output font or output table is written.
       By default the output font (if any) will have a Unicode table when either the input font  has  one,  or  an  explicit  table
       (which  overrides  an input font table) has been provided.  The option -nt causes output of a font without table.  When out‐

       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input
       soelim [-Crtv] [-I dir] [files ...]
       It is possible to have whitespace between the -I command line option and its parameter.
       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form
              .so file
       by  the  contents  of  file.   It  is useful if files included with .so need to be preprocessed.  Normally, soelim should be
       invoked with the -s option of groff.
       To embed ‘\’ in the file name, write ‘\\’ or ‘\e’.  To embed a space, write ‘\ ’.  Any other escape sequence in  file  makes
       soelim ignore the whole line.

       isosize - output the length of an iso9660 filesystem
       isosize [options] iso9660_image_file
       This command outputs the length of an iso9660 filesystem that is contained in the specified file.  This file may be a normal
       file or a block device (e.g. /dev/hdd or /dev/sr0).  In the absence of any options (and errors), it will output the size  of
       -x, --sectors

       -d, --divisor number
              Only has an effect when -x is not given.  The value shown (if no errors) is the iso9660 file size in bytes divided by
              number.  So if number is the block size then the shown value will be the block count.

       options
              Command-line options. See Options.
       The orbd command enables clients to transparently locate and call persistent objects on servers in the CORBA environment.
       The Server Manager included with the orbd tool is used to enable clients to transparently locate and call persistent objects
       on servers in the CORBA environment. The persistent servers, while publishing the persistent object references in the naming
       service, include the port number of the ORBD in the object reference instead of the port number of the server. The inclusion
       of an ORBD port number in the object reference for persistent object references has the following advantages:
       · The object reference in the naming service remains independent of the server life cycle. For example, the object reference
         could be published by the server in the Naming Service when it is first installed, and then, independent of how many times

       xdg-user-dirs-update - Update XDG user dir configuration
       xdg-user-dirs-update updates the current state of the users user-dirs.dir. If none existed before then one is created based
       on the system default values, or falling back to the old non-translated filenames if such directories exists. The list of
       old directories used are: ~/Desktop, ~/Templates and ~/Public.
       If an old configuration exists it is updated with any new default directories. Additionally, any configured directories that
       point to non-existing locations are reset by pointing then to the users home directory. This typically happens when the
       users removed the directory, so they likely don't want to use it anymore.
       On the first run a user-dirs.locale file is created containing the locale that was used for the translation. This is used
       later by gui tools like xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update to detect if the locale was changed, letting you to migrate from the old
       names.

       fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears to have root privileges for file manipulation.  This is  useful
       for  allowing  users  to  create  archives (tar, ar, .deb etc.) with files in them with root permissions/ownership.  Without
       fakeroot one would need to have root privileges to create the constituent files of the archives with the correct permissions

       setkeycodes - load kernel scancode-to-keycode mapping table entries

       The  setkeycodes  command reads its arguments two at a time, each pair of arguments consisting of a scancode (given in hexa‐
       decimal) and a keycode (given in decimal). For each such pair, it tells the kernel keyboard  driver  to  map  the  specified
       scancode to the specified keycode.
       This  command  is  useful only for people with slightly unusual keyboards, that have a few keys which produce scancodes that
       the kernel does not recognize.
THEORY
       The usual PC keyboard produces a series of scancodes for each key press and key release. (Scancodes are shown by showkey -s,

     sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute
     their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end.  The default security policy is sudoers,
     which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins section for more information.

       dbus-cleanup-sockets - clean up leftover sockets in a directory
       dbus-cleanup-sockets [DIRECTORY]
       The dbus-cleanup-sockets command cleans up unused D-Bus connection sockets. See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/
       for more information about the big picture.
       If given no arguments, dbus-cleanup-sockets cleans up sockets in the standard default socket directory for the
       per-user-login-session message bus; this is usually /tmp. Optionally, you can pass a different directory on the command
       line.
       On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because D-Bus defaults to using "abstract sockets" that exist only in memory
       and don't have a corresponding file in /tmp.

       oscap-ssh - Tool for running oscap over SSH and collecting results.
       oscap-ssh runs oscap tool on a remote system through SSH connection. The input files are transfered to the target system and
       after the scan finishes result files are transfered back. No temporary data remains on the remote machine.
       The tool requires bash, ssh, scp and mktemp to perform OVAL and XCCDF evaluation of remote machines. The remote machine also
       has to have oscap installed and in $PATH. This can be accomplished by installing openscap-scanner.
   Evaluation of XCCDF content
       Only source datastreams are supported as INPUT_CONTENT!

       Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.
       wget [option]... [URL]...
       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols,
       as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.
       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to
       start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers
       require constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.
       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the
       directory structure of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading."  While doing that, Wget
       respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (/robots.txt).  Wget can be instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to
       point at the local files, for offline viewing.

       sane-find-scanner - find SCSI and USB scanners and their device files
       sane-find-scanner [-h|-?]  [-v] [-q] [-p] [-f] [-F filename] [devname]
       sane-find-scanner  is  a  command-line tool to find SCSI and USB scanners and determine their Unix device files. Its primary
       aim is to make sure that scanners can be detected by SANE backends.
       For SCSI scanners, it checks the default generic SCSI device files (e.g., /dev/sg0) and /dev/scanner.  The test is  done  by
       sending  a SCSI inquiry command and looking for a device type of "scanner" or "processor" (some old HP scanners seem to send
       "processor"). So sane-find-scanner will find any SCSI scanner connected to those default device files even if it isn't  sup‐
       ported by any SANE backend.
       For  USB  scanners, first the USB kernel scanner device files (e.g.  /dev/usb/scanner0), /dev/usb/scanner, and /dev/usbscan‐
       ner) are tested. The files are opened and the vendor and device ids are determined, if the operating  system  supports  this
       feature.  Currently USB scanners are only found this way if they are supported by the Linux scanner module or the FreeBSD or

       watchgnupg - Read and print logs from a socket
       watchgnupg [--force] [--verbose] socketname
       Most  of the main utilities are able to write their log files to a Unix Domain socket if configured that way.  watchgnupg is
       a simple listener for such a socket.  It ameliorates the output with a time stamp and makes sure that  long  lines  are  not
       interspersed with log output from other utilities.  This tool is not available for Windows.
       watchgnupg is commonly invoked as
         watchgnupg --force ~/.gnupg/S.log
       watchgnupg understands these options:
%
       zgrep - search possibly compressed files for a regular expression
       zgrep [ grep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...
       Zgrep invokes grep on compressed or gzipped files.  All options specified are passed directly to grep.  If no file is speci‐
       fied, then the standard input is decompressed if necessary and fed to grep.  Otherwise the given files are  uncompressed  if
       necessary and fed to grep.
       If the GREP environment variable is set, zgrep uses it as the grep program to be invoked.

       cd-paranoia [options] span [outfile]
       cd-paranoia retrieves audio tracks from CDDA capable CD-ROM drives.  The data can be saved to a file or directed to standard
       output  in  WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C or raw format.  Most ATAPI, SCSI and several proprietary CD-ROM drive makes are supported; cd-
       paranoia can determine if the target drive is CDDA capable.
       In addition to simple reading, cd-paranoia adds extra-robust data verification, synchronization, error handling and  scratch
       reconstruction capability.
       This  version  uses the libcdio library for interaction with a CD-ROM drive. The jitter and error correction however are the
       same as used in Xiph's cdparanoia.

       tclsh - Simple shell containing Tcl interpreter
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
       Tclsh  is  a  shell-like  application that reads Tcl commands from its standard input or from a file and evaluates them.  If
       invoked with no arguments then it runs interactively, reading Tcl commands from standard input and printing command  results
       and  error  messages  to  standard output.  It runs until the exit command is invoked or until it reaches end-of-file on its
       standard input.  If there exists a file .tclshrc (or tclshrc.tcl on the Windows platforms) in  the  home  directory  of  the
       user, interactive tclsh evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before reading the first command from standard input.
SCRIPT FILES
       If  tclsh  is  invoked  with  arguments then the first few arguments specify the name of a script file, and, optionally, the

       abrt-action-generate-core-backtrace - Generates coredump-level backtrace
       abrt-action-generate-core-backtrace [-v] [-r] [-d DIR]
       This tool uses coredump from the file coredump and binary at the path stored in file executable in the problem directory to
       generate coredump-level backtrace.
       Coredump-level backtrace resembles ordinary backtrace in that it contains information about call frames present on the stack
       at the time of the crash. However, it only contains information that can be obtained from the coredump without debugging
       symbols available - mainly relative addresses of the stored instruction pointers. Such backtrace can still be useful for
       reporting and reproducing the bug and does not require debugging information files to be installed.
       The result is saved in the problem directory in a file named core_backtrace.

       As such it shouldn't be of much interest to the regular end-user. However, some modern keyboards have keys or  buttons  that
       produce  scancodes  to  which  the  kernel does not associate a keycode, and, after finding out what these are, the user can

       lsblk - list block devices
       lsblk [options] [device...]
       lsblk  lists  information  about all available or the specified block devices.  The lsblk command reads the sysfs filesystem
       and udev db to gather information.
       The command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a tree-like format by default.  Use lsblk --help to get a list of
       all available columns.
       The  default output, as well as the default output from options like --fs and --topology, is subject to change.  So whenever
       possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.  Always explicitly define expected columns by using --out‐

       fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears to have root privileges for file manipulation.  This is  useful
       for  allowing  users  to  create  archives (tar, ar, .deb etc.) with files in them with root permissions/ownership.  Without
       fakeroot one would need to have root privileges to create the constituent files of the archives with the correct permissions
       and ownership, and then pack them up, or one would have to construct the archives directly, without using the archiver.

       captoinfo - convert a termcap description into a terminfo description
       captoinfo looks in each given text file for termcap descriptions.  For each one found, an equivalent terminfo description is
       written to standard output.  Termcap tc capabilities are translated directly to terminfo use capabilities.
       If no file is given, then the environment variable TERMCAP is used for the filename or entry.  If TERMCAP is a full pathname
       to  a  file, only the terminal whose name is specified in the environment variable TERM is extracted from that file.  If the
       environment variable TERMCAP is not set, then the file /usr/share/terminfo is read.

       tabs - set tabs on a terminal
       tabs [options]] [tabstop-list]
       The tabs program clears and sets tab-stops on the terminal.  This uses the terminfo clear_all_tabs and set_tab capabilities.
       If either is absent, tabs is unable to clear/set tab-stops.  The terminal should be configured to use hard tabs, e.g.,
              stty tab0
   General Options
       -Tname
            Tell tabs which terminal type to use.  If this option is not given, tabs will use the $TERM environment  variable.   If
            that is not set, it will use the ansi+tabs entry.

       gdb-add-index - Add index files to speed up GDB
       gdb-add-index filename
       When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the file in order to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets
       most GDB operations work quickly--at the cost of a delay early on.  For large programs, this delay can be quite lengthy, so
       GDB provides a way to build an index, which speeds up startup.
       To determine whether a file contains such an index, use the command readelf -S filename: the index is stored in a section
       named ".debug_*").

       mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mcopy command is used to copy MS-DOS files to and from Unix. It uses the following syntax:
          mcopy [-bspanvmQT] [-D clash_option] sourcefile targetfile
          mcopy [-bspanvmQT] [-D clash_option] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ] targetdirectory

       Mcopy copies the specified file to the named file, or copies multiple files to the named directory.  The source  and  target
       can be either MS-DOS or Unix files.
       The  use  of  a drive letter designation on the MS-DOS files, 'a:' for example, determines the direction of the transfer.  A

       setcifsacl [-v|-a|-D|-M|-S] "{one or more ACEs}" {file system object}
       This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.
       setcifsacl is a userspace helper program for the Linux CIFS client file system.  It is intended to alter an ACL of a
       security descriptor for a file system object.  Whether a security descriptor to be set is applied or not is determined by
       the CIFS/SMB server.
       This program uses a plugin to handle the mapping of user and group names to SIDs. /etc/cifs-utils/idmap-plugin should be a
       symlink that points to the correct plugin to use.

       gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] -f program-file [ -- ] file ...
       gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ -- ] program-text file ...
       Gawk  is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in
       Kernighan,  and Weinberger.  Gawk provides the additional features found in the current version of Brian Kernighan's awk and
       a number of GNU-specific extensions.
       The command line consists of options to gawk itself, the AWK program text (if not supplied via the -f  or  --file  options),
       and values to be made available in the ARGC and ARGV pre-defined AWK variables.
       When  gawk is invoked with the --profile option, it starts gathering profiling statistics from the execution of the program.
       Gawk runs more slowly in this mode, and automatically produces an execution profile in the file awkprof.out when done.   See

       systemd-escape - Escape strings for usage in system unit names
       systemd-escape may be used to escape strings for inclusion in systemd unit names. The command may be used to escape and to
       undo escaping of strings.
       The command takes any number of strings on the command line, and will process them individually, one after another. It will
       output them separated by spaces to stdout.
       By default, this command will escape the strings passed, unless --unescape is passed which results in the inverse operation
       being applied. If --mangle is given, a special mode of escaping is applied instead, which assumes the string is already
       escaped but will escape everything that appears obviously non-escaped.

       loadunimap - load the kernel unicode-to-font mapping table

       The  loadunimap command is obsolete - its function is now built-in into setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is
       still available as a separate command.
       The program loadunimap loads the specified map in the kernel unicode-to-font mapping table.  If  no  map  is  given  def  is
       assumed.  The default extension (that can be omitted) is .uni.

       command line, only the directives in these files are applied. If only the basename of a file is specified, all directories

       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by  -  accepts  --  to
       signify  the end of the options.  The :, true, false, and test builtins do not accept options and do not treat -- specially.
       The exit, logout, break, continue, let, and shift builtins accept and process arguments beginning with -  without  requiring
       --.  Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with - as
       invalid options and require -- to prevent this interpretation.

       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mmount command is used to mount an MS-DOS disk. It is only available on Linux, as it is only useful  if  the  OS  kernel
       allows to configure the disk geometry. Its syntax is:
       mmount msdosdrive [mountargs]
       Mmount  reads  the  boot sector of an MS-DOS disk, configures the drive geometry, and finally mounts it passing mountargs to
       mount.  If no mount arguments are specified, the name of the device is used. If the disk is write protected, it is automati‐
       cally mounted read only.

       To get notified when the authentication agent has been registered either listen to the Changed D-Bus signal or use
       --notify-fd to pass the number of a file descriptor that has been passed to the program. This file descriptor will then be
       closed when the authentication agent has been successfully registered.
       If --fallback is used, the textual authentication agent will not replace an existing authentication agent.

       sprof - read and display shared object profiling data
       sprof [option]... shared-object-path [profile-data-path]
       The  sprof  command  displays a profiling summary for the shared object (shared library) specified as its first command-line
       argument.  The profiling summary is created using previously generated profiling data in the (optional) second  command-line
       argument.   If  the  profiling data pathname is omitted, then sprof will attempt to deduce it using the soname of the shared
       object, looking for a file with the name <soname>.profile in the current directory.
       The following command-line options specify the profile output to be produced:
       -c, --call-pairs
              Print a list of pairs of call paths for the interfaces exported by the shared object, along with the number of  times
              each path is used.

       iptables-xml — Convert iptables-save format to XML
       iptables-xml [-c] [-v]
       iptables-xml  is used to convert the output of iptables-save into an easily manipulatable XML format to STDOUT.  Use I/O-re‐
       direction provided by your shell to write to a file.
       -c, --combine
              combine consecutive rules with the same matches but different targets. iptables does not currently support more  than
              one  target  per  match,  so  this  simulates that by collecting the targets from consecutive iptables rules into one
              action tag, but only when the rule matches are identical. Terminating actions like RETURN, DROP, ACCEPT and QUEUE are
              not combined with subsequent targets.
       -v, --verbose
              Output xml comments containing the iptables line from which the XML is derived

       firewall-offline-cmd - firewalld offline command line client
       firewall-offline-cmd is an offline command line client of the firewalld daemon. It should be used only if the firewalld
       service is not running. For example to migrate from system-config-firewall/lokkit or in the install environment to configure
       firewall settings with kickstart.
       Some lokkit options can not be automatically converted for firewalld, they will result in an error or warning message. This
       tool tries to convert as much as possible, but there are limitations for example with custom rules, modules and
       masquerading.
       Check the firewall configuration after using this tool.

       consolehelper - A wrapper that helps console users run system programs
       progname [ options ]
       consolehelper is a tool that makes it easy for console users to run system programs, doing authentication via PAM (which can
       be set up to trust all console users or to ask for a password at the system administrator's discretion).  When possible, the
       authentication is done graphically; otherwise, it is done within the text console from which consolehelper was started.
       It  is  intended  to be completely transparent.  This means that the user will never run the consolehelper program directly.
       Instead, programs like /sbin/shutdown are paired with a link from /usr/bin/shutdown to  /usr/bin/consolehelper.   Then  when
       non-root  users (specifically, users without /sbin in their path, or /sbin after /usr/bin) call the "shutdown" program, con‐
       solehelper will be invoked to authenticate the action and then invoke /sbin/shutdown.  (consolehelper itself  has  no  priv‐

       The  umount command detaches the mentioned file system(s) from the file hierarchy.  A file system is specified by giving the

       faked [--debug] [--foreground] [--cleanup] [--key msg-key] [--load] [--save-file save-file] [--port TCP-port]
       If  a  fakeroot process wants to change the ownership of a file, then faked is the process that remembers that new owner. If
       later the same fakeroot process does a stat() for that filename, then the libfakeroot wrapped stat()  call  will  first  ask
       faked for the fake ownership etc of that file, and then report it.

       dbus-send - Send a message to a message bus
                 [--type=TYPE] OBJECT_PATH INTERFACE.MEMBER [CONTENTS...]
       The dbus-send command is used to send a message to a D-Bus message bus. See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for
       more information about the big picture.
       There are two well-known message buses: the systemwide message bus (installed on many systems as the "messagebus" service)
       and the per-user-login-session message bus (started each time a user logs in). The --system and --session options direct
       dbus-send to send messages to the system or session buses respectively. If neither is specified, dbus-send sends to the
       session bus.
       Nearly all uses of dbus-send must provide the --dest argument which is the name of a connection on the bus to send the
       message to. If --dest is omitted, no destination is set.

       wall  displays  a  message,  or  the  contents of a file, or otherwise its standard input, on the terminals of all currently
       logged in users.  The command will wrap lines that are longer than 79 characters.  Short lines are whitespace padded to have
       79 characters.  The command will always put a carriage return and new line at the end of each line.
       Only  the  superuser can write on the terminals of users who have chosen to deny messages or are using a program which auto‐
       matically denies messages.
       Reading from a file is refused when the invoker is not superuser and the program is suid or sgid.

       vstpg (resp. vstpp) gets (resp. puts) files from (resp. onto) a VisioBraille terminal.
       For  communicating  with  the  terminal, you must launch brltty with the BrlNet driver, and telling BrlNet to use the Visio‐
       Braille driver.

       ping  uses  the  ICMP  protocol's  mandatory  ECHO_REQUEST  datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
       ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a struct timeval and then an arbitrary number  of
       ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.

       [-h|--help ] [-v|--version ] [--] [command]
       fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears to have root privileges for file manipulation.  This is  useful
       for  allowing  users  to  create  archives (tar, ar, .deb etc.) with files in them with root permissions/ownership.  Without
       fakeroot one would need to have root privileges to create the constituent files of the archives with the correct permissions
       and ownership, and then pack them up, or one would have to construct the archives directly, without using the archiver.
       effect the real library functions would have had, had the user really been root. These wrapper functions  are  in  a  shared
       library  /usr/lib/*/libfakeroot-*.so  or  similar  location  on  your  platform.   The  shared  object is loaded through the

       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]
       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-
       point by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see  section  OPERATORS),
       until  the  outcome  is known (the left hand side is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on to
       the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.
       If you are using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to  search  directories
       that  are  writable  by  other users), you should read the "Security Considerations" chapter of the findutils documentation,
       which is called Finding Files and comes with findutils.   That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion  than
       this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

       resizecons - change kernel idea of the console size
       resizecons COLSxROWS
       resizecons -lines ROWS
       The resizecons command tries to change the videomode of the console.  There are several aspects to this: (a) the kernel must
       know about it, (b) the hardware must know about it, (c) user programs must know about it, (d) the console font may  have  to
       be adapted.
       (a) The kernel is told about the change using the ioctl VT_RESIZE.  This causes the kernel to reallocate console screen mem‐
       consoles  first.)   If this ioctl succeeds, but a later step fails (e.g., because you do not have root permissions), you may
       be left with a very messy screen.
       The most difficult part of this is (b), since it requires detailed knowledge of the video card hardware, and the setting  of

       xrdb - X server resource database utility
       xrdb [-option ...] [filename]
       Xrdb  is  used  to  get  or  set  the  contents  of  the  RESOURCE_MANAGER  property  on the root window of screen 0, or the
       SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of any or all screens, or everything combined.  You  would  normally  run  this
       program from your X startup file.
       Most  X  clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to get user preferences about color, fonts, and so
       on for applications.  Having this information in the server (where it is available to  all  clients)  instead  of  on  disk,
       solves  the  problem  in previous versions of X that required you to maintain defaults files on every machine that you might
       use.  It also allows for dynamic changing of defaults without editing files.
       The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is used for resources that apply to all screens of the display.  The SCREEN_RESOURCES property
       on  each  screen specifies additional (or overriding) resources to be used for that screen.  (When there is only one screen,

       The  make utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands
       to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of make, which was written by Richard  Stallman  and  Roland
       McGrath,  and  is currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you can
       use make with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.  In fact, make is not limited to pro‐
       grams.   You  can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others
       change.
       To prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among files in your  pro‐
       gram,  and  the  states  the  commands  for updating each file.  In a program, typically the executable file is updated from
       object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.

       dracut - low-level tool for generating an initramfs/initrd image
       dracut [OPTION...] [<image> [<kernel version>]]
       Create an initramfs <image> for the kernel with the version <kernel version>. If <kernel version> is omitted, then the
       version of the actual running kernel is used. If <image> is omitted or empty, then the default location
       /boot/initramfs-<kernel version>.img is used.
       dracut creates an initial image used by the kernel for preloading the block device modules (such as IDE, SCSI or RAID) which
       are needed to access the root filesystem, mounting the root filesystem and booting into the real system.
       At boot time, the kernel unpacks that archive into RAM disk, mounts and uses it as initial root file system. All finding of
       the root device happens in this early userspace.
       Initramfs images are also called "initrd".

       systemd-delta - Find overridden configuration files
       systemd-delta may be used to identify and compare configuration files that override other configuration files. Files in /etc
       have highest priority, files in /run have the second highest priority, ..., files in /lib have lowest priority. Files in a
       directory with higher priority override files with the same name in directories of lower priority. In addition, certain
       configuration files can have ".d" directories which contain "drop-in" files with configuration snippets which augment the
       main configuration file. "Drop-in" files can be overridden in the same way by placing files with the same name in a
       containing directory, which corresponds to the name of the main configuration file, must match). For a fuller explanation,
       The command line argument will be split into a prefix and a suffix. Either is optional. The prefix must be one of the
       directories containing configuration files (/etc, /run, /usr/lib, ...). If it is given, only overriding files contained in

       sg - execute command as different group ID
       sg [-] [group [-c ] command]
       The sg command works similar to newgrp but accepts a command. The command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most
       shells you may run sg from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes. Another difference between newgrp and sg is
       that some shells treat newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell that newgrp creates. This
       doesn't happen with sg, so upon exit from a sg command you are returned to your previous group ID.
CONFIGURATION
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:
       SYSLOG_SG_ENAB (boolean)
           Enable "syslog" logging of sg activity.

       lua - Lua interpreter
       lua [ options ] [ script [ args ] ]
       lua  is the standalone Lua interpreter.  It loads and executes Lua programs, either in textual source form or in precompiled
       binary form.  (Precompiled binaries are output by luac, the Lua compiler.)  lua can be used as a batch interpreter and  also
       interactively.
       The  given  options are handled in order and then the Lua program in file script is loaded and executed.  The given args are
       available to script as strings in a global table named arg.  If no options or arguments are given, then  -v  -i  is  assumed
       when the standard input is a terminal; otherwise, - is assumed.
       In  interactive mode, lua prompts the user, reads lines from the standard input, and executes them as they are read.  If the
       line contains an expression or list of expressions, then the line is evaluated and the results are printed.  If a line  does
       not  contain  a  complete  statement,  then a secondary prompt is displayed and lines are read until a complete statement is

       [-O] [-P permissions] [-p pid_file] [-R] [-s group] [-t write_threads] [-U user]] [-w timeout] [-z delay]
       rrdcached is a daemon that receives updates to existing RRD files, accumulates them and, if enough have been received or a
       defined time has passed, writes the updates to the RRD file. A flush command may be used to force writing of values to disk,
       so that graphing facilities and similar can work with up-to-date data.
       The daemon was written with big setups in mind. Those setups usually run into IO related problems sooner or later for
       reasons that are beyond the scope of this document. Check the wiki at the RRDtool homepage for details. Also check "SECURITY
       CONSIDERATIONS" below before using this daemon! A detailed description of how the daemon operates can be found in the "HOW

       nmap - Network exploration tool and security / port scanner
       nmap [Scan Type...] [Options] {target specification}
       Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
       scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
       hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating
       systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
       characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for
       routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.
       The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each depending on the options used. Key
       among that information is the “interesting ports table”..  That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and
       state. The state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open.  means that an application on the target machine is
       listening for connections/packets on that port.  Filtered.  means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is

       gcore - Generate a core file of a running program

       as if the process crashed (and if "ulimit -c" were used to set up an appropriate core dump limit).  Unlike after a crash,
       after gcore the program remains running without any change.

       vncpasswd - change the VNC password
       vncpasswd [passwd-file]
       vncpasswd -f
       vncpasswd  allows you to set the password used to access VNC desktops.  Its default behavior is to prompt for a VNC password
       and then store an obfuscated version of this password to passwd-file (or to $HOME/.vnc/passwd if no password file is  speci‐
       fied.)  The vncserver script runs vncpasswd the first time you start a VNC desktop, and it invokes Xvnc with the appropriate
       -rfbauth option.  vncviewer can also be given a password file to use via the -passwd option.
       The password must be at least six characters long (unless the -f command-line option is used--  see  below),  and  only  the
       this file can trivially find out the plain-text password, so vncpasswd always sets appropriate permissions (read  and  write
       only  by  the owner.)  However, when accessing a VNC desktop, a challenge-response mechanism is used over the wire making it
       hard for anyone to crack the password simply by snooping on the network.

       ntfsls - list directory contents on an NTFS filesystem

       PATH ] [ -q | --quiet ] [ -s | --system ] [ -V | --version ] [ -v | --verbose ] [ -x | --dos ] device
       ntfsls is used to list information about the files specified by the PATH option (the root directory by default).  DEVICE  is
       the special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX) or an NTFS image file.
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsls accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
       preceded by - and the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be  combined
       into  a  single  command,  e.g.   -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of
       their name.

       gvfs-mount --unmount-scheme=SCHEME
       gvfs-mount --list [OPTION...]
       gvfs-mount --monitor [OPTION...]
       gvfs-mount provides commandline access to various aspects of GIOs mounting functionality.
       Mounting refers to the traditional concept of arranging multiple file systems and devices in a single tree, rooted at /.
       Classical mounting happens in the kernel and is controlled by the mount utility. GIO expands this concept by introducing
       mount daemons that can make file systems available to GIO applications without kernel involvement.

       setmetamode - define the keyboard meta key handling
       setmetamode [ {meta|bit|metabit | esc|prefix|escprefix} ]
       Without argument, setmetamode prints the current Meta key mode.  With argument, it sets the Meta key mode as indicated.  The
       setting before and after the change are reported.
       The Meta key mode is specific for each VT (and the VT corresponding to stdin is used).  One might use setmetamode in /etc/rc
       to define the initial state of the Meta key mode, e.g. by

       grl-inspect is a tool that prints out information on available Grilo sources and metadata keys. When executed with no SOURCE
       argument, grl-inspect will print the list of all plugins and sources. When executed with a SOURCE,  grl-inspect  will  print
       information about that source.

       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input
       soelim [-Crtv] [-I dir] [files ...]
       It is possible to have whitespace between the -I command line option and its parameter.
       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form
              .so file
       by  the  contents  of  file.   It  is useful if files included with .so need to be preprocessed.  Normally, soelim should be
       invoked with the -s option of groff.
       To embed ‘\’ in the file name, write ‘\\’ or ‘\e’.  To embed a space, write ‘\ ’.  Any other escape sequence in  file  makes
       soelim ignore the whole line.

       tbl - format tables for troff
       tbl [-Cv] [files ...]
       This  manual  page  describes  the  GNU version of tbl, which is part of the groff document formatting system.  tbl compiles
       descriptions of tables embedded within troff input files into commands that are understood by troff.  Normally, it should be
       invoked  using  the  -t  option of groff.  It is highly compatible with Unix tbl.  The output generated by GNU tbl cannot be
       processed with Unix troff; it must be processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line or a filename  of
       - is given, the standard input is read.

       abrt-action-analyze-xorg - Calculate and save UUID and duplicate hash for a problem data directory DIR with Xorg backtrace.
       abrt-action-analyze-xorg [-v] [-d DIR]
       The tool reads the file named Xorg.0.log and checks if any black listed module was loaded. If so, not-reportable file is
       created with an appropriate explanation text. If no black listed module was loaded, the tool reads the file named backtrace
       from a problem data directory record and generates a duplication hash and a universally unique identifier (UUID). Then it
       saves this data as new elements duphash and uuid.

       namei - follow a pathname until a terminal point is found
       namei [options] pathname...
       namei  interprets  its  arguments as pathnames to any type of Unix file (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth).  namei
       then follows each pathname until an endpoint is found (a file, a directory, a device node, etc).  If  it  finds  a  symbolic
       link, it shows the link, and starts following it, indenting the output to show the context.
       This program is useful for finding "too many levels of symbolic links" problems.
       For each line of output, namei uses the following characters to identify the file type found:
          f: = the pathname currently being resolved
           d = directory
           l = symbolic link (both the link and its contents are output)

       find-jar - find extension JAR or directory
       find-jar JAR|artifact-coordinates
       The find-jar command tests the resolution of a given element. If successful it will return a JAR file or a directory.
       This command is solely intended for testing resolution and should not be used in scripts. Even for single-element classpath
       building build-classpath is preferred since single-element searches can produce multiple file results when resolving into a
       directory.
DEPENDENCIES
       Using find-jar with artifact-coordinates requires xmvn-resolve command to be available. User of find-jar is responsible for
       making it available in the system.

       mcat - dump raw disk image
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mcat command is used to copy an entire disk image from or to the floppy device. It uses the following syntax:
       mcat [-w] drive:
       Mcat performs the same task as the Unix cat command. It is included into the mtools package, since cat cannot access  remote
       floppy devices offered by the mtools floppy daemon.  Now it is possible to create boot floppies remotely.
       The default operation is reading. The output is written to stdout.
       If  the  -w  option is specified, mcat reads a disk-image from stdin and writes it to the given device.  Use this carefully!

       bashbug - report a bug in bash
       bashbug [--version] [--help] [email-address]
       bashbug  is  a  shell  script  to  help the user compose and mail bug reports concerning bash in a standard format.  bashbug
       invokes the editor specified by the environment variable EDITOR on a temporary copy of the bug report  format  outline.  The
       user  must fill in the appropriate fields and exit the editor.  bashbug then mails the completed report to bug-bash@gnu.org,
       or email-address.  If the report cannot be mailed, it is saved in the file dead.bashbug in the invoking user's  home  direc‐
       tory.
       The bug report format outline consists of several sections.  The first section provides information about the machine, oper‐
       ating system, the bash version, and the compilation environment.  The second section should be filled in with a  description
       of  the  bug.   The third section should be a description of how to reproduce the bug.  The optional fourth section is for a
       proposed fix.  Fixes are encouraged.

       PostScript Interchange (EPSI) format.  EPSI is a special form of encapsulated PostScript (EPS) which adds to  the  beginning
       of  the  file in the form of PostScript comments a bitmapped version of the final displayed page.  Programs which understand
       EPSI (usually word processors or DTP programs) can use this bitmap to give a preview version on screen  of  the  PostScript.
       The displayed quality is often not very good (e.g., low resolution, no colours), but the final printed version uses the real
       PostScript, and thus has the normal PostScript quality.

       setup - A text mode system configuration tool
       setup
       The  setuptool program (setup) is a front-end menu program for a group of other tools, mostly system-config-*-tui tools. The
       list of options which it presents is assembled by scanning /etc/setuptool.d and /usr/share/setuptool/setuptool.d for files.
       Each file in the directory should contain one or more lines of text.  Each line contains from one to four fields  which  are
       separated by "|" characters.  In order, they are:
         - the path to the binary to invoke (mandatory)
         - the untranslated name of the application which should be displayed
           (If unset, defaults to the path of the binary, but don't depend on that.)
         - the gettext textdomain in which a translation of the name of the application can be found
           (If unset, defaults to "setup".)

       Xrefresh  is a simple X program that causes all or part of your screen to be repainted.  This is useful when system messages
       have messed up your screen.  Xrefresh maps a window on top of the desired area of the screen and then immediately unmaps it,
       causing  refresh events to be sent to all applications.  By default, a window with no background is used, causing all appli‐
       cations to repaint ``smoothly.''  However, the various options can be used to indicate  that  a  solid  background  (of  any
       color) or the root window background should be used instead.
       -white    Use a white background.  The screen just appears to flash quickly, and then repaint.
       -black    Use  a  black background (in effect, turning off all of the electron guns to the tube).  This can be somewhat dis‐
                 orienting as everything goes black for a moment.

       mren - rename an existing MSDOS file
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mren command is used to rename or move an existing MS-DOS file or subdirectory. Its syntax is:
       mren [-voOsSrRA] sourcefile targetfile
       Mren renames an existing file on an MS-DOS file system.
       In verbose mode, Mren displays the new filename if the name supplied is invalid.
       If the first syntax is used (only one source file), and if the target name doesn't contain any slashes or colons,  the  file

       rhythmbox-client - controls a running instance of rhythmbox
       rhythmbox-client [option...][file...]
       rhythmbox-client is a tool for controlling an already running instance of rhythmbox.  It's useful for remote control script‐
       ing, adding specific files to the library from the shell, or printing details of what's playing. It also has an  interactive
       mode,  useful for controlling playback remotely via ssh. Any files specified after the option arguments will be added to the
       library.  If the --enqueue option is given, the files will also be added to the play queue.

       resize - set environment and terminal settings to current xterm window size
       resize [ -v | -u | -c ] [ -s [ row col ] ]
       Resize prints a shell command for setting the appropriate environment variables to indicate the current size of xterm window
       from which the command is run.
       Resize determines the command through several steps:
       ·   first, it finds the name of the user's shell program.  It uses the SHELL variable if set, otherwise it uses  the  user's
           data from /etc/passwd.
       ·   then  it  decides whether to use Bourne shell syntax or C-Shell syntax.  It uses a built-in table of known shells, which
           can be overridden by the -u and -c options.

       eject - eject removable media
       eject [options] device|mountpoint
       eject allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, JAZ, ZIP or USB disk) to be ejected under software con‐
       trol.  The command can also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature supported by some  devices,  and
       close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.
       The  device corresponding to device or mountpoint is ejected.  If no name is specified, the default name /dev/cdrom is used.
       The device may be addressed by device name (e.g. 'sda'), device path (e.g. '/dev/sda'), UUID=uuid or LABEL=label tags.
       There are four different methods of ejecting, depending on whether the device is a CD-ROM, SCSI device, removable floppy, or
       tape.  By default eject tries all four methods in order until it succeeds.
       If  a  device  partition  is  specified,  the  whole-disk  device is used.  If the device or a device partition is currently

       The mzip command is used to issue ZIP disk specific commands on Linux, Solaris or HP-UX. Its syntax is:
       mzip [-epqrwx]
       Mzip allows the following command line options:
       e      Ejects the disk.
       f      Force eject even if the disk is mounted (must be given in addition to -e).

       syslinux - install the SYSLINUX bootloader on a FAT filesystem
       Syslinux is a boot loader for the Linux operating system which operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT filesystem. It is intended
       to simplify first-time installation of Linux, and for creation of rescue and other special-purpose boot disks.
       In order to create a bootable Linux floppy using Syslinux, prepare a normal MS-DOS formatted floppy. Copy one or more  Linux
       kernel files to it, then execute the command:
              syslinux --install /dev/fd0
       This will alter the boot sector on the disk and copy a file named ldlinux.sys into its root directory.
       On  boot  time,  by  default,  the kernel will be loaded from the image named LINUX on the boot floppy.  This default can be

       usb-devices - print USB device details
       usb-devices
       usb-devices  is  a  (bash)  shell script that can be used to display details of USB buses in the system and the devices con‐
       nected to them.
       The output of the script is similar to the usb/devices file available either under /proc/bus (if usbfs is mounted), or under
       /sys/kernel/debug (if debugfs is mounted there). The script is primarily intended to be used if the file is not available.
       In  contrast  to  the usb/devices file, this script only lists active interfaces (those marked with a "*" in the usb/devices
       file) and their endpoints.
       Be advised that there can be differences in the way information is sorted, as well as in the format of the output.

       luac - Lua compiler
       luac [ options ] [ filenames ]
       luac  is the Lua compiler.  It translates programs written in the Lua programming language into binary files containing pre‐
       compiled chunks that can be later loaded and executed.
       The main advantages of precompiling chunks are: faster loading, protecting source code from  accidental  user  changes,  and
       off-line syntax checking.  Precompiling does not imply faster execution because in Lua chunks are always compiled into byte‐
       codes before being executed.  luac simply allows those bytecodes to be saved in a file  for  later  execution.   Precompiled
       chunks are not necessarily smaller than the corresponding source.  The main goal in precompiling is faster loading.
       In the command line, you can mix text files containing Lua source and binary files containing precompiled chunks.  luac pro‐
       duces a single output file containing the combined bytecodes for all files given.  Executing the combined file is equivalent
       to executing the given files.  By default, the output file is named luac.out, but you can change this with the -o option.

       lscpu [-a|-b|-c] [-x] [-s directory] [-e[=list]|-p[=list]]
       lscpu -h|-V
       lscpu  gathers  CPU  architecture  information  from sysfs, /proc/cpuinfo and any applicable architecture-specific libraries
       (e.g. librtas on Powerpc).  The command output can be optimized for parsing or for easy readability by humans.  The informa‐
       tion  includes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads, cores, sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes.  There
       is also information about the CPU caches and cache sharing, family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.
       In virtualized environments, the CPU architecture information displayed reflects the configuration of  the  guest  operating
       system  which  is  typically  different  from the physical (host) system.  On architectures that support retrieving physical
       topology information, lscpu also displays the number of physical sockets, chips, cores in the host system.

       certificates,  and providing access to OCSP providers.  Dirmngr is invoked internally by gpg, gpgsm, or via the gpg-connect-
       agent tool.
       For historical reasons it is also possible to start dirmngr in a system daemon mode which uses a different directory layout.
       However, this mode is deprecated and may eventually be removed.
       Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that only one command is allowed.

     ssh-add — adds private key identities to the authentication agent
     ssh-add [-cDdkLlXx] [-E fingerprint_hash] [-t life] [file ...]
     will try to load corresponding certificate information from the filename obtained by appending -cert.pub to the name of the
     private key file.  Alternative file names can be given on the command line.
     If any file requires a passphrase, ssh-add asks for the passphrase from the user.  The passphrase is read from the user's tty.
     ssh-add retries the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.
     The authentication agent must be running and the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable must contain the name of its socket for

       appstream-compose - Generate AppStream metadata
       appstream-compose [OPTION...]
       This manual page documents briefly the appstream-compose command.
       appstream-compose is a simple app that takes a prefix (default /usr) and a set of application names. It looks for appdata,
       metainfo, desktop and icon files with that basename in $prefix/share/[appdata|metainfo|applications|icons] and generates
       appstream xml files and icons in (by default) $prefix/share/app-info.

       gsettings-data-convert - GConf to GSettings data migration
       gsettings-data-convert [option...]
       gsettings-data-convert reads values out of the users GConf database and stores them in GSettings.
       The information about the mapping from GConf keys to GSettings keys is taken from files in /usr/share/GConf/gsettings. Each
       file in that directory is read as a key file, with sections for each GSettings schema that is being converted. The entries
       in each section map GSettings keys to paths in the GConf database. Currently, gsettings-data-convert supports all basic
       GConf types as well as lists of strings and lists of integers.
       A simple example might look like this:
           [org.gnome.fonts]
           antialiasing = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/antialiasing

       ul - do underlining
       ul [options] [file...]
       ul  reads  the  named  files (or standard input if none are given) and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence
       which indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment variable TERM.  The  terminfo  database
       is  read to determine the appropriate sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable of underlining but is capable
       of a standout mode, then that is used instead.  If the terminal can overstrike, or  handles  underlining  automatically,  ul
       -i, --indicated
              Underlining  is  indicated by a separate line containing appropriate dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look
              at the underlining which is present in an nroff output stream on a crt-terminal.

       gsf-office-thumbnailer - office files thumbnailer for the GNOME desktop
       This manual page briefly documents the gsf-office-thumbnailer command.
       gsf-office-thumbnailer  is used internally by GNOME applications such as nautilus to generate thumbnails of several types of
       office application files. While it is possible to invoke it manually, it is usually invoked automatically by nautilus.
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with single letter options starting with a  single  dash  (`-')  and
       longer options starting with two dashes (`--').
   Main options
       -i, --input=filename

       lessecho - expand metacharacters
       lessecho [-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-mx] [-nn] [-ex] [-a] file ...
       lessecho  is  a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output.  But any metacharacter in the output is preceded
       by an "escape" character, which by default is a backslash.
       A summary of options is included below.
       -ex    Specifies "x", rather than backslash, to be the escape char for metachars.  If x is "-", no escape char is  used  and
              arguments containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead.
       -ox    Specifies  "x",  rather  than double-quote, to be the open quote character, which is used if the -e- option is speci‐
              fied.

       gvfs-info - Show information about files
       gvfs-info [OPTION...] [LOCATION...]
       gvfs-info shows information about the given locations.
       gvfs-info is similar to the traditional ls utility, but using gvfs locations instead of local files: for example you can use
       something like smb://server/resource/file.txt as location.
       File attributes can be specified with their gvfs name, e.g. standard::icon, or just by namespace, e.g. unix, or by '*' which
       matches all attributes. Several attributes or groups can be specified, separated by comma.
       By default, gvfs-info shows all attributes.
%
       psfaddtable - add a Unicode character table to a console font
       psfaddtable fontfile tablefile outfile
       psfaddtable  takes  a  console font in .psf format given by fontfile and merges it with the Unicode character table given by
       tablefile to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is written to outfile.  An input file name  of  "-"
       denotes  standard input, and an output file name of "-" denotes standard output.  If the fontfile already contains an embed‐
       ded character table, it is ignored.
TABLE FILE FORMAT
       Each line in the tablefile should be either blank, contain a comment (preceded by #), or contain a sequence  of  numbers  in
       either  decimal  (default), octal (preceded by 0), or hexadecimal (preceded by 0x) format, separated by spaces or tabs.  The
       first number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the font that is being referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff  for  a
       by this specific glyph slot.  Instead of a single Unicode one may have a sequence of Unicodes separates by commas, to denote

       genisoimage - create ISO9660/Joliet/HFS filesystem with optional Rock Ridge attributes
       genisoimage [options] [-o filename] pathspec [pathspec ...]
       genisoimage is a pre-mastering program to generate ISO9660/Joliet/HFS hybrid filesystems.
       genisoimage  is capable of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol records (SUSP) specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange
       Protocol.  This is used to further describe the files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a Unix  host,  and  provides  information
       such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, symbolic links, and block and character device files.
       If  Joliet  or  HFS  hybrid  command  line options are specified, genisoimage will create the additional filesystem metadata
       needed for Joliet or HFS.  Otherwise genisoimage will generate a pure ISO9660 filesystem.
       genisoimage can generate a true (or shared) HFS hybrid filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when accessed from a
       Macintosh  and as ISO9660 files when accessed from other machines. HFS stands for Hierarchical File System and is the native

       makedeltarpm [-v] [-V version] [-z compression] [-s seqfile] [-u] -p oldrpmprint oldpatchrpm oldrpm newrpm deltarpm
       makedeltarpm creates a deltarpm from two rpms. The deltarpm can later be used to recreate the new rpm from either filesystem
       data or the old rpm. Use the -v option to make makedeltarpm more verbose about its work (use it twice to make it  even  more
       verbose).
       If  you want to create a smaller and faster to combine "rpm-only" deltarpm which does not work with filesystem data, specify
       the -r option.
       option  can  be used to specify a different compression method, the default is to use the same compression method as used in
       the new rpm.

       gnome-session - Start the GNOME desktop environment
       gnome-session [-a|--autostart=DIR] [--session=SESSION] [--failsafe|-f] [--debug] [--whale]
       The  gnome-session program starts up the GNOME desktop environment. This command is typically executed by your login manager
       (either gdm, xdm, or from your X startup scripts). It will load either your saved session, or it will provide a default ses‐
       sion for the user as defined by the system administrator (or the default GNOME installation on your system).
       The  default  session  is  defined  in gnome.session, a .desktop-like file that is looked for in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-ses‐
       sion/sessions, $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions and $XDG_DATA_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions.
       When saving a session, gnome-session saves the currently running applications in  the  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/saved-

       mtoolstest - tests and displays the configuration
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mtoolstest command is used to tests the mtools configuration files. To invoke it, just type mtoolstest without any argu‐
       ments.   Mtoolstest  reads the mtools configuration files, and prints the cumulative configuration to stdout. The output can
       be used as a configuration file itself (although you might want to remove redundant clauses).  You may use this  program  to
       convert old-style configuration files into new style configuration files.

       rrdtool - Round Robin Database Tool
       rrdtool - [workdir]| function
       It is pretty easy to gather status information from all sorts of things, ranging from the temperature in your office to the
       number of octets which have passed through the FDDI interface of your router. But it is not so trivial to store this data in
       an efficient and systematic manner. This is where RRDtool comes in handy. It lets you log and analyze the data you gather
       from all kinds of data-sources (DS). The data analysis part of RRDtool is based on the ability to quickly generate graphical
       representations of the data values collected over a definable time period.
       In this man page you will find general information on the design and functionality of the Round Robin Database Tool
       (RRDtool). For a more detailed description of how to use the individual functions of RRDtool check the corresponding man

       fallocate  is  used to manipulate the allocated disk space for a file, either to deallocate or preallocate it.  For filesys‐
       tems which support the fallocate system call, preallocation is done quickly by allocating blocks and marking them as  unini‐
       tialized, requiring no IO to the data blocks.  This is much faster than creating a file by filling it with zeroes.

       abrt-action-analyze-backtrace - Analyzes C/C++ backtrace, generates duplication hash, backtrace rating, and identifies crash
       function in problem directory DIR.
       abrt-action-analyze-backtrace [-v] [-d DIR]
       The tool reads a file named backtrace from problem directory, generates duplication hash, backtrace rating, and identifies
       crash function. Then it saves this data as new elements duphash, rating, crash_function in this problem directory.
   Integration with libreport events
       abrt-action-analyze-backtrace can be used as a secondary analyzer, after backtrace has been generated. The data generated by
       abrt-action-analyze-backtrace is useful for reporting the crash to bug databases: rating makes it possible to prevent
       reporting of bugs with low quality (non-informative) backtraces, duplication hash is used to find already filed bugs about
       similar crashes.

       dbus-run-session is used to start a session bus instance of dbus-daemon from a shell script, and start a specified program
       in that session. The dbus-daemon will run for as long as the program does, after which it will terminate.
       One use is to run a shell with its own dbus-daemon in a text‐mode or SSH session, and have the dbus-daemon terminate
       automatically on leaving the sub‐shell, like this:

       The program loadkeys reads the file or files specified by filename....  Its main purpose is to load the  kernel  keymap  for
       the console.  You can specify console device by the -C (or --console ) option.
RESET TO DEFAULT
       If  the  -d  (or  --default  )  option  is given, loadkeys loads a default keymap, probably the file defkeymap.map either in
       /lib/kbd/keymaps or in /usr/src/linux/drivers/char.  (Probably the former was user-defined, while the  latter  is  a  qwerty
       keyboard map for PCs - maybe not what was desired.)  Sometimes, with a strange keymap loaded (with the minus on some obscure
       unknown modifier combination) it is easier to type `loadkeys defkeymap'.

       is written in order to the output, and a combined check value is calculated from the individual check values.
       The  compressed data format generated is in the gzip, zlib, or single-entry zip format using the deflate compression method.
       The compression produces partial raw deflate streams which are concatenated by a single write thread and  wrapped  with  the
       appropriate header and trailer, where the trailer contains the combined check value.
       Each  partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block (using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to
       end that partial bit stream at a byte boundary.  That allows the partial streams to be concatenated simply as  sequences  of

       the percentage of completion, or -v to make it more verbose about its operation.
       The second an third form can be used to check if the reconstruction is possible. It may fail if the on-disk data got changed
       (deltarpms are created in a way that config file changes do not matter) or the deltarpm does not match the rpm the delta was
       generated  with.  The  -c option selects full (i.e. slow) on-disk checking, whereas -C only checks if the filesizes have not

       symlinks - symbolic link maintenance utility
       symlinks [ -cdorstv ] dirlist
       symlinks  is  a useful utility for maintainers of FTP sites, CDROMs, and Linux software distributions.  It scans directories
       for symbolic links and lists them on stdout, often revealing flaws in the filesystem tree.
       Each link is output with a classification of relative, absolute, dangling, messy, lengthy, or other_fs.
       relative links are those expressed as paths relative to the directory in which the links reside, usually independent of  the
       mount point of the filesystem.

       genisoimage - create ISO9660/Joliet/HFS filesystem with optional Rock Ridge attributes
       genisoimage [options] [-o filename] pathspec [pathspec ...]
       genisoimage is a pre-mastering program to generate ISO9660/Joliet/HFS hybrid filesystems.
       genisoimage  is capable of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol records (SUSP) specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange
       Protocol.  This is used to further describe the files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a Unix  host,  and  provides  information
       such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, symbolic links, and block and character device files.
       If  Joliet  or  HFS  hybrid  command  line options are specified, genisoimage will create the additional filesystem metadata
       needed for Joliet or HFS.  Otherwise genisoimage will generate a pure ISO9660 filesystem.
       genisoimage can generate a true (or shared) HFS hybrid filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when accessed from a
       Macintosh  and as ISO9660 files when accessed from other machines. HFS stands for Hierarchical File System and is the native

       systemd-ask-password - Query the user for a system password
       systemd-ask-password may be used to query a system password or passphrase from the user, using a question message specified
       on the command line. When run from a TTY it will query a password on the TTY and print it to standard output. When run with
       no TTY or with --no-tty it will query the password system-wide and allow active users to respond via several agents. The
       latter is only available to privileged processes.
       The purpose of this tool is to query system-wide passwords -- that is passwords not attached to a specific user account.
       Examples include: unlocking encrypted hard disks when they are plugged in or at boot, entering an SSL certificate passphrase
       for web and VPN servers.
       Existing agents are:

       gnome-disks - the GNOME Disks application
       gnome-disks is the command to launch the GNOME Disks application. Disks provides a way to inspect, format, partition and
       configure disks and block devices.
       The Disks application is single-instance. What this means is that if the application is not already running when the
       gnome-disks command is invoked, it will get launched and the command invocation will block until the application exits.
       Otherwise the existing application instance will be used and the gnome-disks command will exit immediately.

       The mbadblocks command is used to mark some clusters on an MS-DOS filesystem bad. It has the following syntax:
       mbadblocks [-s sectorlist|-c clusterlist|-w] drive:
       If no command line flags are supplied, Mbadblocks scans an MS-DOS filesystem for bad blocks by simply trying  to  read  them
       and flag them if read fails. All blocks that are unused are scanned, and if detected bad are marked as such in the FAT.
       This command is intended to be used right after mformat.  It is not intended to salvage data from bad disks.

       picture  starts  with a line beginning with .PS and ends with a line beginning with .PE.  Anything outside of .PS and .PE is
       passed through without change.
       It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of the PS and PE macros.  When the  macro  package  being
       used  does  not  supply  such  definitions  (for example, old versions of -ms), appropriate definitions can be obtained with

       cpio - copy files to and from archives
__WARNING__
       The  cpio  utility is considered LEGACY based on POSIX specification.  Users are encouraged to use other archiving tools for
       archive creation.
       If you decided to use cpio, you should almost always force cpio to use the ustar format in copy-out mode by  the  -H  option
       (cpio -o -H ustar).  This is because the ustar format is well defined in POSIX specification and thus readable by wide range
       of other archiving tools (including tar e.g.).
       By default, GNU cpio uses (for historical reasons) the very old binary format ('bin') which has significant  problems  nowa‐
       implemented in GNU cpio.  You should, again, consider using other archivers (e.g. 'tar --format=pax').

       below.  This manual page was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, but is not specific to that system.
       emacsclient works in conjunction with the built-in Emacs server.
       You can either call emacsclient directly or let other programs run it for you when necessary.  On GNU and Unix systems  many
       programs consult the environment variable EDITOR (sometimes also VISUAL) to obtain the command used for editing.  Thus, set‐
       ting this environment variable to 'emacsclient' will allow these programs to use  an  already  running  Emacs  for  editing.
       Other operating systems might have their own methods for defining the default editor.
       For  emacsclient  to work, you need an already running Emacs with a server.  Within Emacs, call the functions "server-start"

       application that uses this library to implement a message bus daemon. Multiple programs connect to the message bus daemon
       and can exchange messages with one another.
       There are two standard message bus instances: the systemwide message bus (installed on many systems as the "messagebus" init
       service) and the per-user-login-session message bus (started each time a user logs in).  dbus-daemon is used for both of
       these instances, but with a different configuration file.

       journalctl - Query the systemd journal
       If called without parameters, it will show the full contents of the journal, starting with the oldest entry collected.
       If one or more match arguments are passed, the output is filtered accordingly. A match is in the format "FIELD=VALUE", e.g.
       "_SYSTEMD_UNIT=httpd.service", referring to the components of a structured journal entry. See systemd.journal-fields(7) for
       a list of well-known fields. If multiple matches are specified matching different fields, the log entries are filtered by
       both, i.e. the resulting output will show only entries matching all the specified matches of this kind. If two matches apply
       to the same field, then they are automatically matched as alternatives, i.e. the resulting output will show entries matching
       any of the specified matches for the same field. Finally, the character "+" may appear as a separate word between other
       terms on the command line. This causes all matches before and after to be combined in a disjunction (i.e. logical OR).

       lwp-mirror - Simple mirror utility
        lwp-mirror [-v] [-t timeout] <url> <local file>
       This program can be used to mirror a document from a WWW server.  The document is only transferred if the remote copy is
       newer than the local copy.  If the local copy is newer nothing happens.
       Use the "-v" option to print the version number of this program.
       The timeout value specified with the "-t" option.  The timeout value is the time that the program will wait for response
       from the remote server before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is seconds.  You might append "m" or "h" to
       the timeout value to make it minutes or hours, respectively.
       Because this program is implemented using the LWP library, it only supports the protocols that LWP supports.

       rm - remove files or directories
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directo‐
       ries.
       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files or  the  -r,  -R,  or  --recursive  are
       given,  then  rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the
       entire command is aborted.
       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or  the  -i  or
       --interactive=always  option  is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirma‐

       dbus-launch [--version] [--help] [--sh-syntax] [--csh-syntax] [--auto-syntax] [--binary-syntax] [--close-stderr]
       The dbus-launch command is used to start a session bus instance of dbus-daemon from a shell script. It would normally be
       called from a user's login scripts. Unlike the daemon itself, dbus-launch exits, so backticks or the $() construct can be
       used to read information from dbus-launch.
       With no arguments, dbus-launch will launch a session bus instance and print the address and PID of that instance to standard
       output.
       environment variables so the specified program can find the bus, and then execute the specified program, with the specified
       arguments. See below for examples.

       vlock - Virtual Console lock program
       vlock
       vlock [ -a,--all ] [ -c,--current ] [ -h,--help ] [ -v,--version ]
       vlock  is  a  program to lock one or more sessions on the Linux console.  This is especially useful for Linux machines which
       have multiple users with access to the console.  One user may lock his or her session(s) while still allowing other users to
       use  the  system on other virtual consoles.  If desired, the entire console may be locked and virtual console switching dis‐
       abled.
       By default, only the current VC (virtual console) is locked.  With the -a,-all option all VCs are locked.   The  locked  VCs
       cannot  be  unlocked  without  the  invoker's password.  And, for the paranoid, vlock makes it a trying experience for those
       attempting to guess the password, so unauthorized access to session(s) is highly unlikely.

       taskset - set or retrieve a process's CPU affinity
       taskset [options] mask command [argument...]
       taskset [options] -p [mask] pid
       taskset  is  used  to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a running process given its pid, or to launch a new command with a
       given CPU affinity.  CPU affinity is a scheduler property that "bonds" a process to a given set of CPUs on the system.   The
       scheduler also supports natural CPU affinity: the scheduler attempts to keep processes on the same CPU as long as  practical
       for performance reasons.  Therefore, forcing a specific CPU affinity is useful only in certain applications.
       The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the high‐
       est order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU.  Not all CPUs may exist on a given system but a mask may  specify  more
       CPUs than are present.  A retrieved mask will reflect only the bits that correspond to CPUs physically on the system.  If an
       invalid mask is given (i.e., one that corresponds to no valid CPUs on the current system) an error is returned.   The  masks

       dbus-update-activation-environment - update environment used for D-Bus session services
       dbus-update-activation-environment [--systemd] [--verbose] --all | VAR... | VAR=VAL...
       dbus-update-activation-environment updates the list of environment variables used by dbus-daemon --session when it activates
       session services without using systemd.
       With the --systemd option, if an instance of systemd --user is available on D-Bus, it also updates the list of environment
       variables used by systemd --user when it activates user services, including D-Bus session services for which dbus-daemon has
       been configured to delegate activation to systemd. This is very similar to the import-environment command provided by
       Variables that are special to dbus-daemon or systemd may be set, but their values will be overridden when a service is
       started. For instance, it is not useful to add DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS to dbus-daemon's activation environment, although it
       might still be useful to add it to systemd's activation environment.

       Please  note that this program only works with the Gutenprint CUPS or ESP Print Pro drivers. If you are using the Gutenprint
       stp or ijsgimmprint driver for GhostScript or the drivers for the Gutenprint Print plug-in for  The  GIMP,  the  calibration
       will not work.
       These drivers are identified by the text CUPS+Gutenprint or ESP Print Pro in the model description displayed by the CUPS web
       interface, KUPS, the ESP Print Pro Printer Manager, or printerdrake.
       To make a calibration profile for all users, run this program as the root user.  The program displays a  series  of  prompts
       which should simply be followed.

       aseqnet - ALSA sequencer connectors over network
       aseqnet [remotehost]
       aseqnet  is  an  ALSA  sequencer client which sends and receives event packets over network.  Suppose two hosts connected by
       network, hostA as a server and hostB as a client.  The ALSA sequencer system must be running on both  hosts.   For  creating
       the server port, run the following on hostA:
           hostA% aseqnet
       port, run aseqnet with the hostname of the server:

       Document Format (PDF) languages.  gs reads "files" in sequence and executes them as Ghostscript programs. After doing  this,
       it  reads further input from the standard input stream (normally the keyboard), interpreting each line separately and output
       the  "quit" command (either in a file or from the keyboard), at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such as Control-C at

       patch - apply a diff file to an original
       patch [options] [originalfile [patchfile]]
       but usually just
       patch -pnum <patchfile
       patch  takes  a  patch file patchfile containing a difference listing produced by the diff program and applies those differ‐
       ences to one or more original files, producing patched versions.  Normally the patched versions are  put  in  place  of  the
       originals.  Backups can be made; see the -b or --backup option.  The names of the files to be patched are usually taken from
       the patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can be specified on the command line as originalfile.
       Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff listing, unless overruled by a -c (--context), -e (--ed),  -n
       (--normal), or -u (--unified) option.  Context diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs are applied by the

       virtfs-proxy-helper - QEMU 9p virtfs proxy filesystem helper

           Pass-through security model in QEMU 9p server needs root privilege to do few file operations (like chown, chmod to any
           mode/uid:gid).  There are two issues in pass-through security model
           To overcome above issues, following approach is used: A new filesytem type 'proxy' is introduced. Proxy FS uses chroot +
           socket combination for securing the vulnerability known with following symbolic links.  Intention of adding a new
           filesystem type is to allow qemu to run in non-root mode, but doing privileged operations using socket IO.

       host - DNS lookup utility
       host is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa.
       When no arguments or options are given, host prints a short summary of its command line arguments and options.
       is either the name or IP address of the name server that host should query instead of the server or servers listed in
       /etc/resolv.conf.
       The -a (all) option is equivalent to setting the -v option and asking host to make a query of type ANY.
       When the -C option is used, host will attempt to display the SOA records for zone name from all the listed authoritative

              [ -c command | script | - ] [ arguments ]
       Python  is  an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable power with very clear
       syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python, see the Python Tutorial.   The  Python  Library  Reference  documents
       built-in  and  standard  types, constants, functions and modules.  Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax
       and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.  (These documents may be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES
       below; they may be installed on your system as well.)
       Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be dynami‐
       cally loaded.  Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing applications.  See the internal  documentation

     sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.  The
     invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy.
     sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute
     their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end.  The default security policy is sudoers,
     which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins section for more information.

       In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR)
       followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix text files a line break is a single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text files,
       prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR) character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.

       gpgv - Verify OpenPGP signatures
       gpgv [options] signed_files
       gpgv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.
       This  program is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than
       the fully-blown gpg and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used  to  make  the  signature  are
       valid. There are no configuration files and only a few options are implemented.
       gpgv  assumes  that  all  keys  in  the  keyring are trustworthy.  That does also mean that it does not check for expired or
       revoked keys.
       By default a keyring named ‘trustedkeys.gpg’ is used.  This default keyring is assumed to be in the home directory of GnuPG,
       either  the default home directory or the one set by an option or an environment variable.  The option --keyring may be used

       edid-decode [in] [out]
       edid-decode  decodes  EDID  monitor  description  data  in human-readable format.  It takes zero, one, or two arguments.  If
       invoked with no arguments it reads from standard input and writes to standard output.  With one argument, the file named  by
       the  argument  is read instead.  With two arguments, normal output is suppressed, and the binary EDID blob is written to the
       file named by the second argument.
       Input files may be raw binaries or ASCII text.  ASCII input is scanned for hex dumps; heuristics are included to search  for

       lzop reduces the size of the named files. Whenever possible, each file is compressed into one with the extension .lzo, while
       keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification times. If no files are specified, or if a file name is "-", lzop
       tries to compress the standard input to the standard output. lzop will only attempt to compress regular files or symbolic
       links to regular files.  In particular, it will ignore directories.
       If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, lzop truncates it.

       gtk-update-icon-cache - Icon theme caching utility
                             [--validate] PATH
       gtk-update-icon-cache creates mmapable cache files for icon themes.
       It expects to be given the PATH to a icon theme directory containing an index.theme, e.g.  /usr/share/icons/hicolor, and
       writes a icon-theme.cache containing cached information about the icons in the directory tree below the given directory.
       GTK+ can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot of system call and disk seek overhead when the
       application starts. Since the format of the cache files allows them to be mmaped shared between multiple applications, the
       overall memory consumption is reduced as well.

       mmove - move or rename an MSDOS file or subdirectory
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mmove command is used to moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file or subdirectory.
       mmove [-v] [-D clash_option] sourcefile targetfile
       mmove [-v]  [-D clash_option] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ] targetdirectory
       Mmove moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file or subdirectory. Unlike the MS-DOS version of MOVE, mmove  is  able  to  move
       subdirectories.   Files or directories can only be moved within one file system. Data cannot be moved from MS-DOS to Unix or
       vice-versa.  If you omit the drive letter from the target file or directory, the same letter as for the source  is  assumed.
       If you omit the drive letter from all parameters, drive a: is assumed by default.

       eqn - format equations for troff or MathML
       eqn [-rvCNR] [-d xy] [-T name] [-M dir] [-f F] [-s n] [-p n] [-m n] [files...]
       This  manual  page  describes  the  GNU version of eqn, which is part of the groff document formatting system.  eqn compiles
       descriptions of equations embedded within troff input files into commands that are understood by troff.  Normally, it should
       be  invoked  using  the  -e option of groff.  The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The output of GNU eqn cannot be
       processed with Unix troff; it must be processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the  command  line,  the  standard
       input is read.  A filename of - causes the standard input to be read.
       eqn  searches  for  the  file  eqnrc  in  the  directories  given  with  the  -M option first, then in /etc/groff/site-tmac,
       it before the other input files.  The -R option prevents this.

       genisoimage - create ISO9660/Joliet/HFS filesystem with optional Rock Ridge attributes
       genisoimage [options] [-o filename] pathspec [pathspec ...]
       genisoimage is a pre-mastering program to generate ISO9660/Joliet/HFS hybrid filesystems.
       genisoimage  is capable of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol records (SUSP) specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange
       Protocol.  This is used to further describe the files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a Unix  host,  and  provides  information
       such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, symbolic links, and block and character device files.
       If  Joliet  or  HFS  hybrid  command  line options are specified, genisoimage will create the additional filesystem metadata
       needed for Joliet or HFS.  Otherwise genisoimage will generate a pure ISO9660 filesystem.
       genisoimage can generate a true (or shared) HFS hybrid filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when accessed from a
       Macintosh  and as ISO9660 files when accessed from other machines. HFS stands for Hierarchical File System and is the native

              determined  by  the  operating system (or file system).  Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path itself cannot.
              Wildcard expressions are similar to those supported in commonly used Unix shells (sh, ksh, csh) and may contain:

       preconv - convert encoding of input files to something GNU troff understands
       preconv [-dr] [-e encoding] [files ...]
       preconv -h | --help
       preconv -v | --version
       It is possible to have whitespace between the -e command line option and its parameter.
       Currently, this means ASCII characters and ‘\[uXXXX]’ entities, where ‘XXXX’ is a hexadecimal number with four to  six  dig‐
       its, representing a Unicode input code.  Normally, preconv should be invoked with the -k and -K options of groff.

       nslookup - query Internet name servers interactively
       nslookup [-option] [name | -] [server]
       Nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers.  Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive.
       Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains or to print a list of
       hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested information for a host or domain.

       su - run a command with substitute user and group ID
       su [options] [-] [user [argument...]]
       su allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.
       When called without arguments, su defaults to running an interactive shell as root.
       For  backward  compatibility, su defaults to not change the current directory and to only set the environment variables HOME
       (instead of its shortcut -) to avoid side effects caused by mixing environments.
       This  version  of su uses PAM for authentication, account and session management.  Some configuration options found in other
       su implementations, such as support for a wheel group, have to be configured via PAM.

       checkmodule - SELinux policy module compiler
       checkmodule [-h] [-b] [-C] [-m] [-M] [-U handle_unknown ] [-V] [-o output_file] [input_file]
       This manual page describes the checkmodule command.
       checkmodule  is  a  program  that checks and compiles a SELinux security policy module into a binary representation.  It can
       generate either a base policy module (default) or a non-base policy module (-m option); typically, you would  build  a  non-
       base  policy  module  to  add  to  an existing module store that already has a base module provided by the base policy.  Use
       semodule_package to combine this module with its optional file contexts to create a policy package, and then use semodule to
       install the module package into the module store and load the resulting policy.

       getcifsacl - Userspace helper to display an ACL in a security descriptor for Common Internet File System (CIFS)
       getcifsacl [-v|-r] {file system object}
       This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.
       getcifsacl is a userspace helper program for the Linux CIFS client file system. It is intended to display a security
       descriptor including ACL for a file system object.
       This program uses a plugin to handle the mapping of SIDs to user and group names. /etc/cifs-utils/idmap-plugin should be a
       symlink that points to the correct plugin to use.
       Fields of an ACE such as SID, type, flags, and mask are displayed separated by /.  Numeric values of type, flags, and mask
       are displayed in hexadecimal format.

       renice - alter priority of running processes
       renice [-n] priority [-g|-p|-u] identifier...
       renice  alters  the  scheduling  priority  of one or more running processes.  The first argument is the priority value to be
       used.  The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by  default),  process  group  IDs,  user  IDs,  or  user  names.
       renice'ing  a process group causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered.  renice'ing
       a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority altered.
       -n, --priority priority
              Specify the scheduling priority to be used for the process, process group, or user.  Use of the option -n or --prior‐

       lpr submits files for printing.  Files named on the command line are sent to the named printer or the default destination if
       no destination is specified.  If no files are listed on the command-line, lpr reads the print file from the standard input.
   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS  provides  many  ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST and PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.
       The following options are recognized by lpr:

       zmore - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text
       zmore [ name ...  ]
       Zmore  is  a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy termi‐
       nal.  zmore works on files compressed with compress, pack or gzip, and also on uncompressed  files.   If  a  file  does  not
       exist, zmore looks for a file of the same name with the addition of a .gz, .z or .Z suffix.
       Zmore  normally  pauses  after each screenful, printing --More-- at the bottom of the screen.  If the user then types a car‐
       riage return, one more line is displayed.  If the user hits a space, another screenful is  displayed.   Other  possibilities
       are enumerated later.
       Zmore  looks in the file /etc/termcap to determine terminal characteristics, and to determine the default window size.  On a
       set environment variable PAGER to the name of the desired program, such as less.

       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsfallocate accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The  short
       name  is  preceded by - and the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be
       combined into a single command, e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique  pre‐
       fix of their name.

     ruby — Interpreted object-oriented scripting language
     ruby [--copyright] [--version] [-SUacdlnpswvy] [-0[octal]] [-C directory] [-E external[:internal]] [-F[pattern]]
          [-I directory] [-K[c]] [-T[level]] [-W[level]] [-e command] [-i[extension]] [-r library] [-x[directory]]
          [--{enable|disable}-FEATURE] [--dump=target] [--verbose] [--] [program_file] [argument ...]
     Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process
     text files and to do system management tasks (like in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.
     If you want a language for easy object-oriented programming, or you don't like the Perl ugliness, or you do like the concept
     of LISP, but don't like too many parentheses, Ruby might be your language of choice.
FEATURES
     Ruby's features are as follows:
%
       config_data - Query or change configuration of Perl modules
         # Get config/feature values
         config_data --module Foo::Bar --feature bazzable
         config_data --module Foo::Bar --config magic_number
         # Set config/feature values
         # Print a usage message
         config_data --help
       The "config_data" tool provides a command-line interface to the configuration of Perl modules.  By "configuration", we mean
       something akin to "user preferences" or "local settings".  This is a formalization and abstraction of the systems that
%
       unoconv - convert any document from and to any LibreOffice supported format
       unoconv --listener [--server SRV] [--port PRT] [--connection CON]
       unoconv is a command line utility that can convert any file format that LibreOffice can import, to any file format that
       LibreOffice is capable of exporting.
       unoconv uses the LibreOffice’s UNO bindings for non-interactive conversion of documents and therefore needs an LibreOffice
       instance to communicate with. Therefore if it cannot find one, it will start its own instance for temporary usage. If
       desired, one can start a “listener” instance to use for subsequent connections or even for remote connections.
       -c, --connection
%
       lsns - list namespaces
       lsns [options] [namespace]
       lsns lists information about all the currently accessible namespaces or about the given namespace.  The namespace identifier
       is an inode number.
       The default output is subject to change.  So whenever possible, you should avoid using  default  outputs  in  your  scripts.
       Always  explicitly define expected columns by using the --output option together with a columns list in environments where a
       stable output is required.
       tion.   The  current  /proc  filesystem  may  be unshared and affected by a PID namespace (see unshare --mount-proc for more
       details).  lsns is not able to see persistent namespaces without processes where the namespace instance is held  by  a  bind

       combinedeltarpm [-v] [-V version] [-z compression] [-S signaturerpm] olddeltarpms...  newdeltarpm
       combinedeltarpm creates a new deltarpm from multiple old ones.  Applying the rsulting deltarpm has the same effect as apply‐
       ing each of the old ones in the specified order. Use the -v option to make combinedeltarpm more verbose about its work.
       option  can  be used to specify a different compression method, the default is to use the same compression method as used in
       the last of the old deltarpms.
       If you want to use a different header signature you can also specify a rpm with the -S option which will be used  as  signa‐
       ture reference. This feature can be used to if a deltarpm was made against an unsigned rpm which later got signed.

       Check rrdcreate if you are uncertain about the meaning of the individual keys.
       filename
               The name of the RRD you want to examine.
       --daemon|-d address
               Address of the rrdcached daemon. If specified, a "flush" command is sent to the server before reading the RRD files.
               This allows rrdtool to return fresh data even if the daemon is configured to cache values for a long time.  For a

       to select the output encoding emitted by grotty, groff's TTY output device.  If  neither  the  GROFF_TYPESETTER  environment
       variable  nor the -T command line option (which overrides the environment variable) specifies a (valid) device, nroff checks
       the current locale to select a default output device.  It first tries the locale program,  then  the  environment  variables
       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally the LESSCHARSET environment variable.

       glib-compile-schemas compiles all the GSettings XML schema files in DIRECTORY into a binary file with the name
       gschemas.compiled that can be used by GSettings. The XML schema files must have the filename extension .gschema.xml. For a
       detailed description of the XML file format, see the GSettings documentation.
       In addition to schema files, glib-compile-schemas reads 'vendor override' files, which are key files that can override
       default values for keys in the schemas. The group names in the key files are the schema id, and the values are written in
       serialized GVariant form. Vendor override files must have the filename extension .gschema.override.

       raw /dev/raw/raw<N> /dev/<blockdev>
       raw -q /dev/raw/raw<N>
       raw -qa
       raw  is  used to bind a Linux raw character device to a block device.  Any block device may be used: at the time of binding,
       the device driver does not even have to be accessible (it may be loaded on demand as a kernel module later).
       raw is used in two modes: it either sets raw device bindings, or it queries existing bindings.  When setting a  raw  device,
       /dev/raw/raw<N>  is the device name of an existing raw device node in the filesystem.  The block device to which it is to be

       plymouth - A graphical boot system and logger
       plymouth-set-default-theme [options] <theme>
       plymouth  is  a  graphical  boot system for Linux which takes advantage of the kernel-based mode setting (KMS) available for
       modern graphic cards to provide a seamless, flickerfree and attractive boot screen. It allows  to  choose  between  various,
       static or animated graphical themes to spruce up the startup and avoid the noise generated by the vast amount of kernel mes‐
       sages while the machine boots into X.  On systems where kernel-based mode setting is not available, plymouth falls back to a
       text mode boot screen which provides a simple progress bar to provide feedback during boot.
       To  configure plymouth, that is to choose and install the preferred boot theme, the user has to invoke plymouth-set-default-
       theme. It changes the configuration to the new theme and also performs the necessary regeneration  of  the  initial  ramdisk
       (initrd)  since  plymouth  is  loaded from the boot loader from the initrd prior to the mounting of the root filesystem. The

       gtk-launch launches an application using the given name. The application is started with proper startup notification on a
       default display, unless specified otherwise.
       gtk-launch takes at least one argument, the name of the application to launch. The name should match application desktop
       file name, as residing in /usr/share/application, with or without the '.desktop' suffix.
       If called with more than one argument, the rest of them besides the application name are considered URI locations and are
       passed as arguments to the launched application.
       The following options are understood:

       into the directory.
       If invoked correctly the fipshmac command will not print anything to the standard output or error. Otherwise it will print
       an error message to stderr.
       The -s option allows to specify the suffix of the hmac file names. The default value .hmac is used when this option is not

       Python  is  an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable power with very clear
       syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python, see the Python Tutorial.   The  Python  Library  Reference  documents
       built-in  and  standard  types, constants, functions and modules.  Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax
       and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.  (These documents may be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES
       below; they may be installed on your system as well.)
       Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be dynami‐
       cally loaded.  Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing applications.  See the internal  documentation

       xkbcomp - compile XKB keyboard description
       xkbcomp [option] source [ destination ]
       The  xkbcomp  keymap  compiler converts a description of an XKB keymap into one of several output formats.   The most common
       use for xkbcomp is to create a compiled keymap file (.xkm extension) which can be read directly by XKB-capable X servers  or
       utilities.    The  keymap compiler can also produce C header files or XKB source files.  The C header files produced by xkb‐
       comp can be included by X servers or utilities that need a built-in default keymap.  The XKB source files produced  by  xkb‐
       comp  are fully resolved and can be used to verify that the files which typically make up an XKB keymap are merged correctly
       or to create a single file which contains a complete description of the keymap.
       The source may specify an X display, or an .xkb or .xkm file;   unless  explicitly  specified,  the  format  of  destination
       depends  on  the  format  of  the source.   Compiling a .xkb (keymap source) file generates a .xkm (compiled keymap file) by
       default.   If the source is a .xkm file or an X display, xkbcomp generates a keymap source file by default.

       each compressed in parallel.  The individual check value for each chunk is also calculated in parallel.  The compressed data
       is written in order to the output, and a combined check value is calculated from the individual check values.
       The  compressed data format generated is in the gzip, zlib, or single-entry zip format using the deflate compression method.
       The compression produces partial raw deflate streams which are concatenated by a single write thread and  wrapped  with  the
       appropriate header and trailer, where the trailer contains the combined check value.
       Each  partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block (using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to
       end that partial bit stream at a byte boundary.  That allows the partial streams to be concatenated simply as  sequences  of

       grops  translates the output of GNU troff to PostScript.  Normally grops should be invoked by using the groff command with a
       -Tps option.  (Actually, this is the default for groff.)  If no files are given, grops reads the standard input.  A filename
       of  - also causes grops to read the standard input.  PostScript output is written to the standard output.  When grops is run
       by groff options can be passed to grops using groff's -P option.

       nping - Network packet generation tool / ping utility
       nping [Options] {targets}
       Nping is an open-source tool for network packet generation, response analysis and response time measurement. Nping allows
       users to generate network packets of a wide range of protocols, letting them tune virtually any field of the protocol
       headers. While Nping can be used as a simple ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw packet
       generator for network stack stress tests, ARP poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route tracing, and other purposes.
       Additionally, Nping offers a special mode of operation called the "Echo Mode", that lets users see how the generated probes
       change in transit, revealing the differences between the transmitted packets and the packets received at the other end. See
       section "Echo Mode" for details.
       The output from Nping is a list of the packets that are being sent and received. The level of detail depends on the options
       used.

       Crontabs  is a historical name for the run-parts script and the system crontab. The run-parts script runs all executables in
       the specified directory.  Run-parts runs all executables in the specified directory.  The execution of files can be  allowed
       or  denied  by creating file jobs.allow or jobs.deny which worked similar as other allow/deny config files. The file must be
       created in the specified directory.
       --list print names of all files (not limited to executables), but don't run them.  This  option  can't  be  used  with  test
              option.
       --test print names of files, which would be run.
              Randomization  of  jobs  can be configured in the /etc/sysconfig/run-parts file. To enable randomization of jobs, set

       dbus-monitor - debug probe to print message bus messages
       dbus-monitor [--system | --session | --address ADDRESS] [--profile | --monitor | --pcap | --binary] [watch expressions]
       The dbus-monitor command is used to monitor messages going through a D-Bus message bus. See
       http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more information about the big picture.
       There are two well-known message buses: the systemwide message bus (installed on many systems as the "messagebus" service)
       and the per-user-login-session message bus (started each time a user logs in). The --system and --session options direct
       dbus-monitor to monitor the system or session buses respectively. If neither is specified, dbus-monitor monitors the session
       bus.
       dbus-monitor has two different text output modes: the 'classic'-style monitoring mode, and profiling mode. The profiling
       format is a compact format with a single line per message and microsecond-resolution timing information. The --profile and
       --monitor options select the profiling and monitoring output format respectively.

          [-e scriptexpression] [--expression=scriptexpression]
          [-f scriptfile] [--file=scriptfile]
          [file ...]
       dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports unlimited precision arithmetic.  It also allows you to define and call
       macros.  Normally dc reads from the standard input; if any command arguments are given to it, they  are  filenames,  and  dc
       reads  and  executes the contents of the files before reading from standard input.  All normal output is to standard output;
       all error output is to standard error.
       A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack.  Entering a number pushes it on the stack.  Arithmetic operations pop
       arguments off the stack and push the results.

       wvdial - PPP dialer with built-in intelligence.
       wvdial  is  an intelligent PPP dialer, which means that it dials a modem and starts PPP in order to connect to the Internet.
       rather than forcing you to write a login script.
       When  wvdial starts, it first loads its configuration from /etc/wvdial.conf and ~/.wvdialrc which contains basic information
       about the modem port, speed, and init string, along with information about your Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as the
       phone number, your username, and your password.
       Then it initializes your modem and dials the server and waits for a connection (a CONNECT string from the modem).  It under‐
       stands and responds to typical connection problems (like BUSY and NO DIALTONE).

       dnf - DNF Command Reference
       dnf [options] <command> [<args>...]
       DNF is the next upcoming major version of Yum, a package manager for RPM-based Linux distributions. It roughly maintains CLI
       compatibility with Yum and defines strict API for extensions and plugins. Plugins can modify or extend features  of  DNF  or
       provide  additional CLI commands on top of those mentioned below. If you know the name of such a command (including commands
       mentioned below), you may find/install the package which provides it using the appropriate virtual provide in  the  form  of
       dnf-command(<alias>) where <alias> is the name of the command; e.g.  dnf install 'dnf-command(repoquery)' to install a repo‐
       query plugin (the same applies to specifying dependencies of packages that require a particular DNF command).
       Available commands:

       kill - terminate a process
       kill [-signal|-s signal|-p] [-q value] [-a] [--] pid|name...
       kill -l [number] | -L
       The  command  kill  sends the specified signal to the specified processes or process groups.  If no signal is specified, the
       TERM signal is sent.  This TERM signal will kill processes that do not catch it; for other processes it may be necessary  to
       use the KILL signal (number 9), since this signal cannot be caught.
       Most  modern  shells  have  a builtin kill function, with a usage rather similar to that of the command described here.  The
       --all, --pid, and --queue options, and the possibility to specify processes by command name, are local extensions.
       If signal is 0, then no actual signal is sent, but error checking is still performed.

       zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text
       zless [ name ...  ]
       Zless  is  a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy termi‐
       nal.  It is the equivalent of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- %s', and the environment variable
       LESSMETACHARS  to  '<space><tab><newline>;*?"()<>[|&^`#\$%=~',  and then running less.  However, enough people seem to think
       that having the command zless available is important to be worth providing it.
BUGS
       Zless does not work with compressed data that is piped to it via standard input; it requires that input files  be  specified
       as arguments.  To read compressed data from a pipe, you can use ...|gunzip|less instead of ...|zless.

       xz, unxz, xzcat, lzma, unlzma, lzcat - Compress or decompress .xz and .lzma files
       xz [option...]  [file...]
       unxz is equivalent to xz --decompress.
       xzcat is equivalent to xz --decompress --stdout.
       lzma is equivalent to xz --format=lzma.
       unlzma is equivalent to xz --format=lzma --decompress.
       lzcat is equivalent to xz --format=lzma --decompress --stdout.
       When  writing  scripts that need to decompress files, it is recommended to always use the name xz with appropriate arguments
       (xz -d or xz -dc) instead of the names unxz and xzcat.

       pic - compile pictures for troff or TeX
       pic [ -nvCSU ] [ filename ... ]
       pic -t [ -cvzCSU ] [ filename ... ]
       This  manual  page  describes  the  GNU version of pic, which is part of the groff document formatting system.  pic compiles
       descriptions of pictures embedded within troff or TeX input files into commands that are understood by TeX or  troff.   Each
       picture  starts  with a line beginning with .PS and ends with a line beginning with .PE.  Anything outside of .PS and .PE is
       passed through without change.
       It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of the PS and PE macros.  When the  macro  package  being
       used  does  not  supply  such  definitions  (for example, old versions of -ms), appropriate definitions can be obtained with
       -mpic: These will center each picture.

       tracepath [-n] [-b] [-l pktlen] [-m max_hops] [-p port] destination
       It traces path to destination discovering MTU along this path.  It uses UDP port port or some random port.  It is similar to
       traceroute, only does not require superuser privileges and has no fancy options.
       tracepath6 is good replacement for traceroute6 and classic example of application of Linux error queues.  The situation with

       mkfontdir - create an index of X font files in a directory
       mkfontdir [-n] [-x suffix] [-r] [-p prefix] [-e encoding-directory-name] ...  [--] [directory-name ... ]
       For  each  directory argument, mkfontdir reads all of the font files in the directory searching for properties named "FONT",
       and,  along with the name of the font file, are written out to the file "fonts.dir" in the directory.  The X server and font
       server use "fonts.dir" to find font files.
       The kinds of font files read by mkfontdir depend on configuration parameters, but typically include PCF (suffix ".pcf"), SNF
       (suffix  ".snf")  and  BDF (suffix ".bdf").  If a font exists in multiple formats, mkfontdir will first choose PCF, then SNF
       and finally BDF.
       The first line of fonts.dir gives the number of fonts in the file.  The remaining lines list the fonts themselves,  one  per
       line, in two fields.  First is the name of the font file, followed by a space and the name of the font.

       ar - create, modify, and extract from archives
       The GNU ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives.  An archive is a single file holding a collection of other
       files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive).
       The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be
       restored on extraction.
       GNU ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how ar is configured on your
       system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility with archive formats maintained with other tools.  If

       setleds - set the keyboard leds
       setleds [-v] [-L] [-D] [-F] [{+|-}num] [{+|-}caps] [{+|-}scroll]
       Setleds  reports  and  changes  the led flag settings of a VT (namely NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock).  Without arguments,
       setleds prints the current settings.  With arguments, it  sets  or  clears  the  indicated  flags  (and  leaves  the  others
       unchanged). The settings before and after the change are reported if the -v flag is given.
       The led flag settings are specific for each VT (and the VT corresponding to stdin is used).
       By  default  (or  with option -F), setleds will only change the VT flags (and their setting may be reflected by the keyboard
       leds).
       With option -D, setleds will change both the VT flags and their default settings (so that a subsequent reset will  not  undo
       the change).  This might be useful for people who always want to have numlock set.

       Baobab - A graphical tool to analyze disk usage
       baobab  [directory]
       baobab is able to scan either specific folders (local and remote) or devices, in order to give the user a tree representa‐
       tion including each directory size or percentage in the branch. It also auto-detects any mounted/unmounted device. A graphi‐
       cal representation is also provided for any selected folder.
       A detailed documentation on the program could be read at: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Baobab

       gvfs-trash - Move files or directories to the trash
       gvfs-trash [OPTION...] [LOCATION...]
       gvfs-trash sends files or directories to the "Trashcan". This can be a different folder depending on where the file is
       directory, the trash folder is $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash.
       interested in deleting a file irreversibly, see gvfs-rm.
       Inspecting and emptying the "Trashcan" is normally supported by graphical file managers such as nautilus, but you can also

       tbl - format tables for troff
       tbl [-Cv] [files ...]
       This  manual  page  describes  the  GNU version of tbl, which is part of the groff document formatting system.  tbl compiles
       descriptions of tables embedded within troff input files into commands that are understood by troff.  Normally, it should be
       invoked  using  the  -t  option of groff.  It is highly compatible with Unix tbl.  The output generated by GNU tbl cannot be
       processed with Unix troff; it must be processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line or a filename  of
       - is given, the standard input is read.
       -C     Enable  compatibility  mode  to  recognize .TS and .TE even when followed by a character other than space or newline.
              Leader characters (\a) are handled as interpreted.

       Bdftopcf  is  a font compiler for the X server and font server.  Fonts in Portable Compiled Format can be read by any archi‐

       lexgrog - parse header information in man pages
       lexgrog [-m|-c] [-dfw?V] [-E encoding] file ...
       lexgrog  is  an  implementation  of the traditional “groff guess” utility in lex.  It reads the list of files on its command
       line as either man page source files or preformatted “cat” pages, and displays their name and description as used by apropos
       and whatis, the list of preprocessing filters required by the man page before it is passed to nroff or troff, or both.
       If  its  input  is badly formatted, lexgrog will print “parse failed”; this may be useful for external programs that need to
       check man pages for correctness.  If one of lexgrog's input files is “-”, it will read from standard  input;  if  any  input
       file is compressed, a decompressed version will be read automatically.

       This  manual  page  describes  the  GNU version of eqn, which is part of the groff document formatting system.  eqn compiles

       The mkmanifest command is used to create a shell script (packing list) to restore Unix filenames. Its syntax is:
       mkmanifest [ files ]
       Mkmanifest creates a shell script that aids in the restoration of Unix filenames that got clobbered by the  MS-DOS  filename
       names, and no illegal characters.
       The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used in pcomm, arc, and mtools to change perfectly good Unix filenames
       to  fit the MS-DOS restrictions. This command is only useful if the target system which will read the diskette cannot handle

       dfu-tool [ --verbose ]  [ --version ]  [ --force ]  [ --device=VID:PID ]  [ --transfer-size=BYTES ]
       This manual page documents briefly the dfu-tool command.
       dfu-tool  allows a user to write various kinds of firmware onto devices supporting the USB Device Firmware Upgrade protocol.
       This tool can be used to switch the device from the normal runtime mode to `DFU mode' which allows  the  user  to  read  and
       write  firmware.  Either the whole device can be written in one operation, or individual `targets' can be specified with the
       alternative name or number.
       dfu-tool uses the libdfu shared library to perform actions.  All synchronous actions can be safely cancelled and on  failure

       Xvnc  is  the  X  VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server.  It is based on a standard X server, but it has a "virtual" screen
       rather than a physical one.  X applications display themselves on it as if it were a normal X display, but they can only  be

       be used to provide IP network information in human readable format, in a format suitable for parsing  in  scripts,  generate
       random private addresses, resolve an IP address, or check the validity of an address.
       By  default  or when the --info or --all-info parameters are specified the information provided is free form human readable.
       Otherwise, when specific options are given (e.g., --prefix) the output is in the VAR=VALUE format.
       The various options specify what information ipcalc should display on standard out. Multiple options may be  specified.   An
       IP address to operate on must always be specified, and several operations also require a netmask or a CIDR prefix as well.

       ld [options] objfile ...
       ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step
       in compiling a program is to run ld.
       ld accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of AT&T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide
       explicit and total control over the linking process.
       This man page does not describe the command language; see the ld entry in "info" for full details on the command language
       and on other aspects of the GNU linker.
       This version of ld uses the general purpose BFD libraries to operate on object files. This allows ld to read, combine, and
       write object files in many different formats---for example, COFF or "a.out".  Different formats may be linked together to

       To  manage  BSD-style  utmp  files, sessreg has two strategies.  In conjunction with xdm, the -x option counts the number of
       lines in /etc/ttys and then adds to that the number of the line in the Xservers file which specifies the display.  The  dis‐

       directory in which they live. However, files with identical filenames replace each other. Files in /etc/kernel/install.d/
       take precedence over files with the same name in /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/. This can be used to override a system-supplied
       executables with a local file if needed; a symbolic link in /etc/kernel/install.d/ with the same name as an executable in
       /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/, pointing to /dev/null, disables the executable entirely. Executables must have the extension

       mapscrn [-v] [-o map.orig] mapfile
       The  mapscrn  command  is  obsolete - its function is now built-in into setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is
       still available as a separate command.
       The mapscrn command loads a user defined output character mapping table into the console driver. The console driver  may  be
       later  put  into  use  user-defined  mapping table mode by outputting a special escape sequence to the console device.  This
       is saved in map.orig.
USE
       There  are two kinds of mapping tables: direct-to-font tables, that give a font position for each user byte value, and user-
       to-unicode tables that give a unicode value for each user byte. The corresponding glyph is now found using the unicode index

       gvfs-mime - Get or set mime handlers
       gvfs-mime --query {MIMETYPE}
       gvfs-mime --set {MIMETYPE} {HANDLER}
       gvfs-mime can query information about applications that are registered to handle a mime-type, or set the default handler for
       a mime-type.
       Gvfs obtains this information from the shared-mime-info database. The default handler is stored per-user, in the file
       $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/mimeapps.list.
       MIMETYPE should be a mime-type such as text/plain or application/mbox. HANDLER should be the name of an existing desktop
       file such as gedit.desktop.

       lwp-download - Fetch large files from the web
       lwp-download [-a] [-s] <url> [<local path>]
       The lwp-download program will save the file at url to a local file.
       If local path is not specified, then the current directory is assumed.
       If local path is a directory, then the last segment of the path of the url is appended to form a local filename.  If the url
       path ends with slash the name "index" is used.  With the -s option pick up the last segment of the filename from server
       provided sources like the Content-Disposition header or any redirect URLs.  A file extension to match the server reported
       Content-Type might also be appended.  If a file with the produced filename already exists, then lwp-download will prompt
       before it overwrites and will fail if its standard input is not a terminal.  This form of invocation will also fail is no
       acceptable filename can be derived from the sources mentioned above.

       In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination of two characters: a Carriage Return (CR)
       followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix text files a line break is a single character: the Line Feed (LF). In Mac text files,
       prior to Mac OS X, a line break was single Carriage Return (CR) character. Nowadays Mac OS uses Unix style (LF) line breaks.

       newgrp - log in to a new group
       newgrp [-] [group]
       The newgrp command is used to change the current group ID during a login session. If the optional - flag is given, the
       user's environment will be reinitialized as though the user had logged in, otherwise the current environment, including
       current working directory, remains unchanged.
       newgrp changes the current real group ID to the named group, or to the default group listed in /etc/passwd if no group name
       is given.  newgrp also tries to add the group to the user groupset. If not root, the user will be prompted for a password if
       she does not have a password (in /etc/shadow if this user has an entry in the shadowed password file, or in /etc/passwd
       otherwise) and the group does, or if the user is not listed as a member and the group has a password. The user will be
       denied access if the group password is empty and the user is not listed as a member.

       systemd-inhibit - Execute a program with an inhibition lock taken
       systemd-inhibit may be used to execute a program with a shutdown, sleep or idle inhibitor lock taken. The lock will be
       acquired before the specified command line is executed and released afterwards.
       Inhibitor locks may be used to block or delay system sleep and shutdown requests from the user, as well as automatic idle
       handling of the OS. This is useful to avoid system suspends while an optical disc is being recorded, or similar operations
       that should not be interrupted.

       make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs
       make [OPTION]... [TARGET]...
       The  make utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands
       to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of make, which was written by Richard  Stallman  and  Roland
       McGrath,  and  is currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you can
       use make with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command.  In fact, make is not limited to pro‐
       grams.   You  can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others
       change.
       To prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among files in your  pro‐
       gram,  and  the  states  the  commands  for updating each file.  In a program, typically the executable file is updated from
       object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.

       Below  is  a summary of all the options that ntfstruncate accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short
       name is preceded by - and the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument,  can  be
       combined  into a single command, e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique pre‐
       fix of their name.

       The sockfd argument is a file descriptor that refers to a socket of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.
       The backlog argument defines the maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for sockfd may grow.  If a connec‐
       tion  request  arrives when the queue is full, the client may receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED or, if the

       terminated with SIGINT (^C from the terminal) or a timeout expires.
       If  you  accidentally  start  dumping  a  stream from the USB keyboard you use to control the terminal, the system will stop
       receiving the input and you won't be able to terminate usbhid-dump. Just stop your input and wait until the timeout expires.
       The stream dumping will stop, the keyboard will be reattached to the kernel driver and you will regain control.

       aulast - a program similar to last
       aulast [ options ]
       aulast  is  a  program that prints out a listing of the last logged in users similarly to the program last and lastb. Aulast
       searches back through the audit logs or the given audit log file and displays a list of all users logged in (and out)  based
       entries matching the arguments.
       The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is rebooted. Thus last reboot will show a log of all reboots  since  the
       log file was created.
       The  main  difference  that  a user will notice is that aulast print events from oldest to newest, while last prints records
       from newest to oldest. Also, the audit system is not notified each time a tty or pty is allocated, so you may not see  quite

       abrt-action-analyze-java - Calculate and save UUID & DUPHASH and determine the level of usability for reporting of a Java
       stack trace.
       abrt-action-analyze-java [-v] [-d DIR] [-o] [-f FILE]
       The tool reads the file named backtrace from a problem data directory, processes it and generates a universally unique
       identifier (UUID). Then it saves this data as new element uuid. It also checks whether the stack trace contains a remote
       address in any of its frames and if so it creates not-reportable element whose contents explains why the stack trace should
       not be reported into a bug tracking system.
       abrt-action-analyze-java can be used to generate the UUID & DUPHAS of a newly saved Java stack trace.

       bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language
       bc [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [  file ... ]
       bc  is  a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements.  There are some simi‐
       larities in the syntax to the C programming language.  A standard math library is available  by  command  line  option.   If
       requested,  the math library is defined before processing any files.  bc starts by processing code from all the files listed
       on the command line in the order listed.  After all files have been processed, bc reads from the standard input.   All  code
       is  executed  as  it  is  read.   (If  a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc will never read from the standard
       input.)
       This version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc implementations and the POSIX draft standard.   Command
       line options can cause these extensions to print a warning or to be rejected.  This document describes the language accepted
       by this processor.  Extensions will be identified as such.

       setfacl [-bkndRLPvh] [{-m|-x} acl_spec] [{-M|-X} acl_file] file ...
       setfacl --restore=file
       This utility sets Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories.  On the command line, a sequence of commands is fol‐
       lowed by a sequence of files (which in turn can be followed by another sequence of commands, ...).
       The options -m, and -x expect an ACL on the command line. Multiple ACL entries are separated by comma characters (`,').  The
       options -M, and -X read an ACL from a file or from standard input. The ACL entry format is described in Section ACL ENTRIES.
       The  --set  and --set-file options set the ACL of a file or a directory. The previous ACL is replaced.  ACL entries for this
       operation must include permissions.

       catman - create or update the pre-formatted manual pages
       catman [-d?V] [-M path] [-C file] [section] ...
       catman  is  used to create an up to date set of pre-formatted manual pages known as cat pages.  Cat pages are generally much
       faster to display than the original manual pages, but require extra storage space.  The decision to  support  cat  pages  is
       that of the local administrator, who must provide suitable directories to contain them.
       The  options  available  to  catman are the manual page hierarchies and sections to pre-format.  The default hierarchies are
       those specified as system hierarchies in the man-db configuration file, and the default sections are either the colon-delim‐
       ited  contents of the environment variable $MANSECT or the standard set compiled into man if $MANSECT is undefined.  Supply‐
       ing catman with a set of whitespace-delimited section names will override both of the above.
       catman makes use of the index database cache associated with each hierarchy to determine which files need to be formatted.

       The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Management Tool, crlutil, is a command-line utility that can list, generate, modify,
       or delete CRLs within the NSS security database file(s) and list, create, modify or delete certificates entries in a
       particular CRL.
       The key and certificate management process generally begins with creating keys in the key database, then generating and

              [ -c command | script | - ] [ arguments ]
       Python  is  an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable power with very clear
       syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python, see the Python Tutorial.   The  Python  Library  Reference  documents
       built-in  and  standard  types, constants, functions and modules.  Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax
       and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too) much detail.  (These documents may be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES
       below; they may be installed on your system as well.)
       Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be dynami‐
       cally loaded.  Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing applications.  See the internal  documentation

       mdeltree - recursively delete an MSDOS directory and its contents
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mdeltree command is used to delete an MS-DOS file. Its syntax is:
       mdeltree [-v] msdosdirectory [msdosdirectories...]
       Mdeltree removes a directory and all the files and subdirectories it contains from an MS-DOS file system. An error occurs if
       the directory to be removed does not exist.

       ntfsrecover - Recover updates committed by Windows on an NTFS volume
       ntfsrecover [options] device
       ntfsrecover applies to the metadata the updates which were requested on Windows but could not be completed because they were
       interrupted by some event such as a power failure, a hardware crash, a software crash or the device being unplugged.   Doing
       so, the file system is restored to a consistent state, however updates to user data may still be lost.
       Updating the file system generally requires updating several records which should all be made for the file system to be kept
       consistent. For instance, creating a new file requires reserving an inode number (set a bit in a bit map), creating  a  file
       record  (store the file name and file attributes), and registering the file in a directory (locate the file from some path).
       When an unfortunate event occurs, and one of these updates could be done but not all of them, the file system is left incon‐
       sistent.
       A  group of updates which have all to be done to preserve consistency is called a transaction, and the end of updates within

       under  the  name by which it was invoked and tests or extracts the contents of the appended archive.  Because the executable
       stub adds bulk to the archive (the whole purpose of which is to be as small as possible), a number of the  less-vital  capa‐
       bilities  in  regular unzip have been removed.  Among these are the usage (or help) screen, the listing and diagnostic func‐
       tions (-l and -v), the ability to decompress older compression formats (the ``reduce,'' ``shrink'' and ``implode'' methods).
       The  ability  to  extract  to  a directory other than the current one can be selected as a compile-time option, which is now
       simple ``run command after extraction'' feature.  This feature is currently incompatible with  the  ``extract  to  different
       directory'' feature and remains disabled by default.

       bose] [-B|--buffer-size [=size]] [-V|--version] [device-specific-options]
       scanimage is a command-line interface to control image acquisition devices such as flatbed scanners or cameras.  The  device
       is  controlled  via  command-line  options.  After command-line processing, scanimage normally proceeds to acquire an image.
       The image data is written to standard output in one of the PNM (portable aNyMaP) formats (PBM  for  black-and-white  images,
       PGM  for grayscale images, and PPM for color images), TIFF format (black-and-white, grayscale or color), PNG format, or JPEG
       format.  scanimage accesses image acquisition devices through the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) interface and can thus sup‐
       port any device for which there exists a SANE backend (try apropos sane- to get a list of available backends).

       pwscore - simple configurable tool for checking quality of a password
       pwscore [user]
       pwscore is a simple tool for checking quality of a password. The password is read from stdin.
       The tool uses the libpwquality library to perform configurable checks for minimum length, dictionary checking against
       cracklib dictionaries, and other checks.
       It either reports an error if the password fails any of the checks, or it prints out the password quality score as an
       be treated as moderate quality and above it fairly strong quality. Any password that passes the quality checks (especially

       mtools - utilities to access DOS disks in Unix.
       Mtools  is  a collection of tools to allow Unix systems to manipulate MS-DOS files: read, write, and move around files on an
       MS-DOS file system (typically a floppy disk).  Where reasonable, each program attempts to emulate the MS-DOS equivalent com‐
       mand. However, unnecessary restrictions and oddities of DOS are not emulated. For instance, it is possible to move subdirec‐
       tories from one subdirectory to another.
       Mtools is sufficient to give access to MS-DOS file systems.  For instance, commands such as mdir a: work on  the  a:  floppy
       without  any  preliminary  mounting or initialization (assuming the default `/etc/mtools.conf' works on your machine).  With
       mtools, one can change floppies too without unmounting and mounting.
Where to get mtools
       Mtools can be found at the following places (and their mirrors):

%
       gendiff - utility to aid in error-free diff file generation
       gendiff <directory> <diff-extension>
       gendiff  is  a rather simple script which aids in generating a diff file from a single directory.  It takes a directory name
       and a "diff-extension" as its only arguments.  The diff extension should be a unique sequence of characters added to the end
       of  all original, unmodified files.  The output of the program is a diff file which may be applied with the patch program to
       recreate the changes.
       The usual sequence of events for creating a diff is to create two identical directories, make changes in one directory,  and
       then use the diff utility to create a list of differences between the two.  Using gendiff eliminates the need for the extra,
       original and unmodified directory copy.  Instead, only the individual files that are modified need to be saved.
       Before editing a file, copy the file, appending the extension you have chosen to the filename.  I.e. if you  were  going  to
       edit  somefile.cpp  and have chosen the extension "fix", copy it to somefile.cpp.fix before editing it.  Then edit the first

       This compiler is typically run by the makefiles created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker or by Module::Build or other Perl module
       build tools.
       xsubpp will compile XS code into C code by embedding the constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and
       creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those functions.  The compiler uses typemaps to determine how to map C
       function parameters and variables to Perl values.
       The compiler will search for typemap files called typemap.  It will use the following search path to find default typemaps,
       with the rightmost typemap taking precedence.

       For configuration options that allow multiple different settings (e.g.  scrolling), all available settings are  listed.  The
       default setting is prefixed by an asterisk (*).
       This tool usually needs to be run as root to have access to the /dev/input/eventX nodes.

       mmcli - Control and monitor the ModemManager
       mmcli [OPTION...]
       ModemManager  is  a  DBus-powered Linux daemon which provides a unified high level API for communicating with (mobile broad‐
       band) modems. It acts as a standard RIL (Radio Interface Layer) and may be used by different connection managers, like  Net‐
       workManager. Thanks to the built-in plugin architecture, ModemManager talks to very different kinds of modems with very dif‐
       ferent kinds of ports. In addition to the standard AT serial ports, Qualcomm-based QCDM and QMI ports are also supported.

       rygel - a collection of DLNA/UPnP AV services
       rygel [options]
       rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, video and pictures, and control of media player on
       your home network. In technical terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer implemented through a plug-in
       mechanism. Interoperability with other devices in the market is achieved by conformance to very strict requirements of DLNA
       and on the fly conversion of media to format that client devices are capable of handling.
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of
       options is included below.

       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mclasserase command is used to wipe memory cards by overwriting it three times: first with 0xff, then  with  0x00,  then
       with 0xff again. The command uses the following syntax:
          mclasserase [-d] msdosdrive
       MS-DOS drive is optional, if none is specified, use A:. If more than one drive are specified, all but the last are ignored.
       Mclasserase accepts the following command line options:

       xhost - server access control program for X
       xhost [[+-]name ...]
       The  xhost  program  is  used  to  add  and delete host names or user names to the list allowed to make connections to the X
       a workstation (single user) environment, although it does limit the worst abuses.  Environments which require more sophisti‐
       cated measures should implement the user-based mechanism or use the hooks in the protocol for passing  other  authentication
       data to the server.
       Xhost  accepts the following command line options described below.  For security, the options that affect access control may
       only be run from the "controlling host".  For workstations, this is the same machine as the server.  For X terminals, it  is
       the login host.

       uuidgen - create a new UUID value
       uuidgen [options]
       UUID can reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created on the local system, and among UUIDs created on other  sys‐
       tems in the past and in the future.
       There  are  two types of UUIDs which uuidgen can generate: time-based UUIDs and random-based UUIDs.  By default uuidgen will
       generate a random-based UUID if a high-quality random number generator is present.  Otherwise, it will choose  a  time-based
       UUID.  It is possible to force the generation of one of these two UUID types by using the -r or -t options.
       -r, --random
              Generate  a  random-based  UUID.   This method creates a UUID consisting mostly of random bits.  It requires that the

              resolve_initial_references and list_initial_references methods.
       Java IDL includes the Object Request Broker Daemon (ORBD). ORBD is a daemon process that contains a Bootstrap Service, a
       Transient Naming Service, a Persistent Naming Service, and a Server Manager. The Java IDL tutorials all use ORBD, but you
       can substitute the tnameserv command for the orbd command in any of the examples that use a Transient Naming Service.

       mcd - change MSDOS directory
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or com‐
       plete.  See the end of this man page for details.
       The mcd command is used to change the mtools working directory on the MS-DOS disk. It uses the following syntax:
          mcd [msdosdirectory]
       Without arguments, mcd reports the current device and working directory.  Otherwise, mcd changes the current device and cur‐
       rent working directory relative to an MS-DOS file system.
       The environmental variable MCWD may be used to locate the file where the device and current working directory information is
       stored.  The default is `$HOME/.mcwd'.  Information in this file is ignored if the file is more than 6 hours old.

              Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...
       Any  further  lines  you enter will be copied to the specified user's terminal.  If the other user wants to reply, they must
       run write as well.
       When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.  The other user will see the message EOF indicating that  the

       pinfo - curses based lynx-style info browser
       pinfo [options] [infopage]
       This  is  a program for viewing info files. You specify which page you want to read by passing it an infopage argument. This
       argument contains the name of an info page (i.e. 'bash').  The program will then (by default) search for it in  the  current
       directory,  /usr/share/info,  /usr/info,  /usr/local/share/info,  /usr/local/info.   and  /opt/info.  The search path can be
       adjusted by INFOPATH environment variable or in the configuration  file.  Pinfo  will  also  automatically  add  the  suffix
       to the function openinfo() in filehandling_functions.c.
       When the search for info pages fails, man is called with the infopage argument, and it's output is  parsed  by  pinfo.  This
       means that when you don't have the appropriate info page, but have a man page instead; the man page will be viewed.
       When no infopage is specified, the default `dir' page is shown.

       hostnamectl - Control the system hostname
       hostnamectl may be used to query and change the system hostname and related settings.
       This tool distinguishes three different hostnames: the high-level "pretty" hostname which might include all kinds of special
       characters (e.g. "Lennart's Laptop"), the static hostname which is used to initialize the kernel hostname at boot (e.g.
       "lennarts-laptop"), and the transient hostname which is a fallback value received from network configuration. If a static
       hostname is set, and is valid (something other than localhost), then the transient hostname is not used.
       limited to the usually accepted characters of Internet domain names.

       gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] -f program-file [ -- ] file ...
       gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ -- ] program-text file ...
       Gawk  is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in
       Kernighan,  and Weinberger.  Gawk provides the additional features found in the current version of Brian Kernighan's awk and
       a number of GNU-specific extensions.
       The command line consists of options to gawk itself, the AWK program text (if not supplied via the -f  or  --file  options),
       and values to be made available in the ARGC and ARGV pre-defined AWK variables.
       When  gawk is invoked with the --profile option, it starts gathering profiling statistics from the execution of the program.
       Gawk runs more slowly in this mode, and automatically produces an execution profile in the file awkprof.out when done.   See

       virsh - management user interface
       The virsh program is the main interface for managing virsh guest domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and
       shutdown domains. It can also be used to list current domains. Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization
       capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software available under the GNU Lesser General Public
       License. Virtualization of the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of Operating Systems
       concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aims at
       providing a long term stable C API.  It currently supports Xen, QEMU, KVM, LXC, OpenVZ, VirtualBox and VMware ESX.

       ausyscall - a program that allows mapping syscall names and numbers
       ausyscall [arch] name | number | --dump | --exact
       ausyscall  is a program that prints out the mapping from syscall name to number and reverse for the given arch. The arch can
       be anything returned by `uname -m`. If arch is not given, the program will take a guess based on the running image. You  may
       give  the syscall name or number and it will find the opposite. You can also dump the whole table with the --dump option. By
       default a syscall name lookup will be a substring match meaning that it will try to match all occurrences of the given  name
       with  syscalls.  So  giving a name of chown will match both fchown and chown as any other syscall with chown in its name. If
       this behavior is not desired, pass the --exact flag and it will do an exact string match.
       This program can be used to verify syscall numbers on a biarch platform for rule optimization. For example, suppose you  had
       an auditctl rule:
       -a always, exit -S open -F exit=-EPERM -k fail-open

       If --regex is not specified, PATTERNs can contain globbing characters.  If any  PATTERN  contains  no  globbing  characters,
       locate behaves as if the pattern were *PATTERN*.
       By default, locate does not check whether files found in database still exist (but it does require all parent directories to
       exist if the database was built with --require-visibility no).  locate can never report files created after the most  recent
       update of the relevant database.

       regdbdump - parse and print out regulatory rules file
       regdbdump <path-to-regulatory.bin>
       regdbdump can be used to parse the regulatory.bin file, the Linux wireless regulatory database used by crda, and print out
       its contents in human readable format.  regdbdump will return non zero if the digital signature regdbdump was built with
       cannot verify the signature of the regulatory database.  Should this happen unintentionally chances are your regulatory.bin

       ifup - bring a network interface up
       ifdown - take a network interface down
       ifup CONFIG [boot]
       ifdown CONFIG
       The  ifup  and ifdown commands may be used to configure (or, respec- tively, deconfigure) network interfaces based on inter‐
       face definitions in the files /etc/sysconfig/network and /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<configuration>
       These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the configuration (e.g. eth0). They are called with a second  argument
       of "boot" during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be
       ignored at that time.
%
       netreport - request notification of network interface changes
       netreport [-r]
       netreport tells the network management scripts to send a SIGIO signal to the process which called netreport when any network
       interface status changes occur.
       -r     Remove the current request (if any) for the calling process.
       If a program does not call netreport with the -r option before it exits, and another process is created with  the  same  PID
       before any changes take place in interface status, it is possible that the new process will receive a spurious SIGIO.

       mkntfs  is  used  to  create an NTFS file system on a device (usually a disk partition) or file.  device is the special file
       corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).  number-of-sectors is the number of sectors on the device. If  omitted,  mkntfs
       automagically figures the file system size.
       Below is a summary of all the options that mkntfs accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is

       thin_metadata_size - thin provisioning metadata device/file size calculator.
       thin_metadata_size [options]
       thin_metadata_size  calculates  the  size  of the thin provisioning metadata based on the block size of the thin provisioned
       devices, the size of the thin provisioning pool and the maximum number of all thin prisioned devices and snapshots.  Because
       thin provisioning pools are holding widely variable contents, this tool is needed to provide sensible initial default size.

       chkconfig [--level levels] [--type type] [--no-redirect] name
       chkconfig  provides  a  simple  command-line tool for maintaining the /etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy by relieving system
       administrators of the task of directly manipulating the numerous symbolic links in those directories.
       This implementation of chkconfig was inspired by the chkconfig command present in the IRIX  operating  system.  Rather  than
       maintaining  configuration  information  outside of the /etc/rc[0-6].d hierarchy, however, this version directly manages the
       symlinks in /etc/rc[0-6].d. This leaves all of the configuration information regarding what services init starts in a single

       fping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
       fping [ options ] [ systems... ] fping6 [ options ] [ systems... ]
       fping is a program like ping which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target
       host is responding.  fping differs from ping in that you can specify any number of targets on the command line, or specify a
       file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will
       send out a ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.  In the default mode, if a target replies,
       it is noted and removed from the list of targets to check; if a target does not respond within a certain time limit and/or
       retry limit it is designated as unreachable. fping also supports sending a specified number of pings to a target, or looping
       indefinitely (as in ping ). Unlike ping, fping is meant to be used in scripts, so its output is designed to be easy to
       parse.

       cifs.idmap - Userspace helper for mapping ids for Common Internet File System (CIFS)
       cifs.idmap [--help|-h] [--timeout|-t] [--version|-v] {keyid}
       This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.
       cifs.idmap is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client filesystem. There are a number of activities that the
       kernel cannot easily do itself. This program is a callout program that does these things for the kernel and then returns the
       result.
       run directly from the command-line, it is not generally intended to be run that way.
       This program is only called if a share is mounted with the cifsacl mount option. The kernel will only upcall to do this
       conversion if that mount option is specified.

OPERATION
       The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a central server which maintains a list of IP addresses which may be assigned  on
       one or more subnets.  A DHCP client may request an address from this pool, and then use it on a temporary basis for communi‐
       cation on network.  The DHCP protocol also provides a mechanism whereby a client can learn important details about the  net‐

       fsck.fat - check and repair MS-DOS filesystems
       fsck.fat verifies the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems and optionally tries to repair them.
       The following filesystem problems can be corrected (in this order):
       *   FAT contains invalid cluster numbers.  Cluster is changed to EOF.
       *   File's cluster chain contains a loop.  The loop is broken.
       *   Bad  clusters  (read  errors).   The clusters are marked bad and they are removed from files owning them.  This check is
           optional.

                       [-z] [zone]
       dnssec-coverage verifies that the DNSSEC keys for a given zone or a set of zones have timing metadata set properly to ensure
       no future lapses in DNSSEC coverage.
       If zone is specified, then keys found in the key repository matching that zone are scanned, and an ordered list is generated
       of the events scheduled for that key (i.e., publication, activation, inactivation, deletion). The list of events is walked
       in order of occurrence. Warnings are generated if any event is scheduled which could cause the zone to enter a state in
       which validation failures might occur: for example, if the number of published or active keys for a given algorithm drops to
       zero, or if a key is deleted from the zone too soon after a new key is rolled, and cached data signed by the prior key has

       xfs_metadump [ -aefFgow ] [ -m max_extents ] ] [ -l logdev ] source target
       xfs_metadump -V
       xfs_metadump is a debugging tool that copies the metadata from an XFS filesystem to a file.  The source argument must be the
       pathname of the device or file containing the XFS filesystem and the target argument specifies the  destination  file  name.
       If target is -, then the output is sent to stdout. This allows the output to be redirected to another program such as a com‐
       pression application.
       xfs_metadump may only be used to copy unmounted filesystems, or read-only mounted filesystems.
       xfs_metadump does not alter the source filesystem in any way. The target image is a contiguous (non-sparse) file  containing
       all the filesystem's metadata and indexes to where the blocks were copied from.

       The  safe_finger  command  protects  against  nasty stuff from finger servers. Use this program for automatic reverse finger
       probes from the tcp_wrapper (tcpd) , not the raw finger command. The safe_finger command makes sure that the  finger  client

       tect you from problems caused by the output of some finger servers. The problem: some programs may react  to  stuff  in  the
       first column. Other programs may get upset by thrash anywhere on a line. File systems may fill up as the finger server keeps
       sending data. Text editors may bomb out on extremely long lines.  The finger server may take forever because it  is  somehow

       One  mode  is  better for filesystem operation debugging.  It is called the transactional view and is enabled through the -t
       option. The transactional view prints only the portion of the log that pertains to recovery. In other words, it  prints  out
       complete  transactions between the tail and the head. This view tries to display each transaction without regard to how they
       are split across log records.
       The second mode starts printing out information from the beginning of the log.  Some error blocks might  print  out  in  the
       beginning  because the last log record usually overlaps the oldest log record. A message is printed when the physical end of

       hardlink - Consolidate duplicate files via hardlinks
       This  manual  page  documents  hardlink,  a  program  which  consolidates  duplicate  files in one or more directories using
       hardlinks.
       hardlink traverses one or more directories searching for duplicate files.  When it finds duplicate files,  it  uses  one  of
       them  as  the  master.  It then removes all other duplicates and places a hardlink for each one pointing to the master file.
       This allows for conservation of disk space where multiple directories on a single filesystem contain many duplicate files.
       Since hard links can only span a single filesystem, hardlink is only useful when all directories specified are on  the  same
       filesystem.

       source filesystem by the filesystem and the XFS log.  The space saving is because xfs_copy seeks over free blocks instead of
       copying them and the XFS filesystem supports sparse files efficiently.

       depmod [-e] [-E Module.symvers] [-F System.map] [-m] [-n] [-v] [-P prefix] [-w] [version] [filename...]
       Linux kernel modules can provide services (called "symbols") for other modules to use (using one of the EXPORT_SYMBOL
       variants in the code). If a second module uses this symbol, that second module clearly depends on the first module. These
       dependencies can get quite complex.
       depmod creates a list of module dependencies by reading each module under /lib/modules/version and determining what symbols
       it exports and what symbols it needs. By default, this list is written to modules.dep, and a binary hashed version named
       modules.dep.bin, in the same directory. If filenames are given on the command line, only those modules are examined (which
       is rarely useful unless all modules are listed).  depmod also creates a list of symbols provided by modules in the file
       named modules.symbols and its binary hashed version, modules.symbols.bin. Finally, depmod will output a file named

       mpathconf - A tool for configuring device-mapper-multipath
       mpathconf [commands] [options]
       mpathconf  is  a  utility that creates or modifies /etc/multipath.conf.  It can enable or disable multipathing and configure
       some common options.  mpathconf can also load the dm_multipath module, start and stop the multipathd daemon,  and  configure
       the  multipathd  service to start automatically or not. If mpathconf is called with no commands, it will display the current
       configuration.

       dmidecode - DMI table decoder
       dmidecode  is  a  tool  for dumping a computer's DMI (some say SMBIOS) table contents in a human-readable format. This table
       contains a description of the system's hardware components, as well as other useful pieces of  information  such  as  serial
       numbers  and  BIOS  revision. Thanks to this table, you can retrieve this information without having to probe for the actual
       hardware.  While this is a good point in terms of report speed and safeness, this also makes the presented information  pos‐
       sibly unreliable.
       The  DMI  table doesn't only describe what the system is currently made of, it also can report the possible evolutions (such
       as the fastest supported CPU or the maximal amount of memory supported).
       SMBIOS stands for System Management BIOS, while DMI stands for Desktop Management  Interface.  Both  standards  are  tightly
       related and developed by the DMTF (Desktop Management Task Force).

       sssd [options]
       SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It provides an NSS and
       PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different account sources as well as
       D-Bus interface. It is also the basis to provide client auditing and policy services for projects like FreeIPA. It provides
       a more robust database to store local users as well as extended user data.

           SSSD supports two representations for specifying the debug level. The simplest is to specify a decimal value from 0-9,
           which represents enabling that level and all lower-level debug messages. The more comprehensive option is to specify a

       usbmuxd - Expose a socket to multiplex connections from and to iOS devices.
       usbmuxd  stands  for  "USB  multiplexing  daemon".  This  daemon is in charge of multiplexing connections over USB to an iOS
       device. To users, it means you can sync your music, contacts, photos, etc. over USB. To developers, it means you can connect
       to  any listening localhost socket on the device. usbmuxd is not used for tethering data transfer which uses a dedicated USB
       interface as a virtual network device. Multiple connections to different TCP ports can happen in parallel. The  higher-level
       layers are handled by libimobiledevice.
       When  usbmuxd  is running (normally started, or stopped as a result of "udev" auto-insertion messages or by systemd) it pro‐
       vides a socket interface in "/var/run/usbmuxd" that is designed to be compatible with the socket interface that is  provided
       on Mac OS X.
       You  should also create a "usbmux" user that has access to USB devices on your system. Alternatively, you can pass a differ‐

       btrfs-inspect-internal - query various internal information
       btrfs inspect-internal <subcommand> <args>
       This command group provides an interface to query internal information. The functionality ranges from a simple UI to an
       ioctl or a more complex query that assembles the result from several internal structures. The latter usually requires calls
       to privileged ioctls.

       cupsreject [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -r reason ] destination(s)
       The cupsaccept command instructs the printing system to accept print jobs to the specified destinations.
       The cupsreject command instructs the printing system to reject print jobs to the specified destinations.  The -r option sets
       the reason for rejecting print jobs. If not specified, the reason defaults to "Reason Unknown".
       The following options are supported by both cupsaccept and cupsreject:
       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       userdel - delete a user account and related files
       userdel [options] LOGIN
       The userdel command modifies the system account files, deleting all entries that refer to the user name LOGIN. The named
       user must exist.
       The options which apply to the userdel command are:
       -f, --force
           This option forces the removal of the user account, even if the user is still logged in. It also forces userdel to
           remove the user's home directory and mail spool, even if another user uses the same home directory or if the mail spool
           is not owned by the specified user. If USERGROUPS_ENAB is defined to yes in /etc/login.defs and if a group exists with

       strfile - create a random access file for storing strings
       unstr - dump strings in pointer order
       strfile [-iorsx] [-c char] sourcefile [outputfile]
       unstr [-c char] datafile[.ext] [outputfile]
       strfile reads a file containing groups of lines separated by a line containing a single percent `%' sign (or other specified
       delimiter character) and creates a data file which contains a header structure and a table of file offsets for each group of
       lines. This allows random access of the strings.
       The output file, if not specified on the command line, is named sourcefile.dat.
       The  purpose  of  unstr  is  to  undo  the work of strfile.  It prints out the strings contained in the sourcefile, which is
       the  name of the datafile) in the order that they are listed in the header file datafile.  If no outputfile is specified, it

       dkms [action] [options] [module/module-version] [/path/to/source-tree] [/path/to/tarball.tar] [/path/to/driver.rpm]
       dkms  is  a framework which allows kernel modules to be dynamically built for each kernel on your system in a simplified and
       organized fashion.
ACTIONS
       add [module/module-version] [/path/to/source-tree] [/path/to/tarball.tar]
           Adds a module/module-version combination to the tree for builds and installs.  If module/module-version, -m  module/mod‐
           ule-version,  or  -m  module -v  version  are passed as options, this command requires source in /usr/src/<module>-<mod‐
           ule-version>/ as well as a properly formatted dkms.conf file. If  /path/to/source-tree  is  passed  as  an  option,  and
           source-tree  contains  a  dkms.conf  file,  it  will  copy  /path/to/source-tree  to /usr/src/module-module-version.  If
           /path/to/tarball.tar is passed, this command behaves like the ldtarball command.

       foomatic-kitload - installs a data kit into the foomatic database.
       foomatic-kitload [ -k kit-dir] [ -d dest-dir]...
       foomatic-kitload  installs  a foomatic data kit into the local data library.  It takes a -k dirname option, where dirname is
       the toplevel directory of a foomatic driver "kit".  A "kit" is a selection of XML source files arranged exactly  as  in  the
       source/section of the master database (ie, opt/driver/printer/ subdirs).
       Gimp-Print's foomatic-generator produces exactly such a kit.
       Foomatic-kitload  is  moderately  paranoid  about kits: the kit must contain at least one of printer, driver or opt; the kit
       must contain only files ending in .xml, the kit cannot be the local library itself, etc.  But it does not inspect  the  con‐
       tents of the kit files in any way.

       Each of the ethernets being connected corresponds to one physical interface in the bridge. These  individual  ethernets  are
       bundled into one bigger ('logical') ethernet, this bigger ethernet corresponds to the bridge network interface.
INSTANCES
       The  command  brctl  addbr  <name> creates a new instance of the ethernet bridge. The network interface corresponding to the
       bridge will be called <name>.

       pptp - PPTP driver
       pptp <pptp-server-IP> <pptp-options> [ppp-options] ...
       pptp establishes the client side of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).  Use
       this program to connect to an employer's PPTP based VPN, or to certain cable and ADSL service providers.
       By default, pptp establishes the PPTP call to the PPTP server, and then starts an instance of pppd to manage the data trans‐
       fer.  However, pptp can also be run as a connection manager within pppd.
       The first non-option argument on the pptp command line must be the host name or IP address of the PPTP server.
       All long options (starting with "--") are interpreted as pptp options, and a fatal error occurs if an unrecognised option is
       used.

       mkhomedir_helper is a helper program for the pam_mkhomedir module that creates home directories and populates them with
       contents of the specified skel directory.
       The helper is separated from the module to not require direct access from login SELinux domains to the contents of user home
       directories. The SELinux domain transition happens when the module is executing the mkhomedir_helper.
       The helper never touches home directories if they already exist.

     ifenslave is a tool to attach and detach slave network devices to a bonding device.  A bonding device will act like a normal
     Ethernet network device to the kernel, but will send out the packets via the slave devices using a simple round-robin sched‐
     uler.  This allows for simple load-balancing, identical to "channel bonding" or "trunking" techniques used in switches.
     The kernel must have support for bonding devices for ifenslave to be useful.

       swapon, swapoff - enable/disable devices and files for paging and swapping
       swapon [options] [specialfile...]
       swapoff [-va] [specialfile...]
       swapon is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping are to take place.
       The  device  or  file  used  is given by the specialfile parameter.  It may be of the form -L label or -U uuid to indicate a
       device by label or uuid.
       Calls to swapon normally occur in the system boot scripts making all swap devices available, so that the paging and swapping
       activity is interleaved across several devices and files.
       swapoff  disables swapping on the specified devices and files.  When the -a flag is given, swapping is disabled on all known
       swap devices and files (as found in /proc/swaps or /etc/fstab).

       This manual page describes the setfiles program.
       This  program  is  primarily used to initialize the security context fields (extended attributes) on one or more filesystems
       (or parts of them).  Usually it is initially run as part of the SELinux installation  process  (a  step  commonly  known  as
       labeling).
       It  can also be run at any other time to correct inconsistent labels, to add support for newly-installed policy or, by using
       the -n option, to passively check whether the file contexts are all set as specified by the active policy (default behavior)
       or by some other policy (see the -c option).
       If  a file object does not have a context, setfiles will write the default context to the file object's extended attributes.

       setup - A text mode system configuration tool
       setup
       The  setuptool program (setup) is a front-end menu program for a group of other tools, mostly system-config-*-tui tools. The
       list of options which it presents is assembled by scanning /etc/setuptool.d and /usr/share/setuptool/setuptool.d for files.
       Each file in the directory should contain one or more lines of text.  Each line contains from one to four fields  which  are
       separated by "|" characters.  In order, they are:
         - the path to the binary to invoke (mandatory)
         - the untranslated name of the application which should be displayed
           (If unset, defaults to the path of the binary, but don't depend on that.)
         - the gettext textdomain in which a translation of the name of the application can be found
           (If unset, defaults to "setup".)

       isc-hmac-fixup - fixes HMAC keys generated by older versions of BIND
       isc-hmac-fixup {algorithm} {secret}
       Versions of BIND 9 up to and including BIND 9.6 had a bug causing HMAC-SHA* TSIG keys which were longer than the digest
       incorrectly, generating a message authentication code that was incompatible with other DNS implementations.
       This bug has been fixed in BIND 9.7. However, the fix may cause incompatibility between older and newer versions of BIND,
       when using long keys.  isc-hmac-fixup modifies those keys to restore compatibility.
       To modify a key, run isc-hmac-fixup and specify the key's algorithm and secret on the command line. If the secret is longer
       secret will be generated consisting of a hash digest of the old secret. (If the secret did not require conversion, then it
       will be printed without modification.)

       provided.
       If  --test  action  is  specified,  the  authconfig just reads the current settings from the various configuration files and
       prints their values.  If --update action is specified, authconfig must be run by root (or through console helper), and  con‐
       figuration  changes  are saved. Only the files affected by the configuration changes are overwritten.  If --updateall action
       is specified, authconfig must be run by root (or through console helper), and all  configuration  files  are  written.   The
       --probe  action  instructs authconfig to use DNS and other means to guess at configuration information for the current host,
       print its guesses if it finds them, to standard output, and exit.

       fixparts - MBR partition table repair utility
       fixparts device
       FixParts  (aka  fixparts) is a text-mode menu-driven program for repairing certain types of problems with Master Boot Record
       (MBR) partition tables. The program has three design goals, although a few additional features are supported, as well:
       *      It can remove stray GUID Partition Table (GPT) data, which can be left behind on a disk that was once used as  a  GPT
       *      It  can  repair mis-sized extended partitions -- either partitions that extend beyond the physical end of the disk or
              that overlap with nearby primary partitions. FixParts is designed in such a way that this type of repair occurs auto‐
              matically,  so if it's the only problem with your disk, you can launch the program and then immediately save the par‐
              tition table, making no manual changes, and the program will fix the problem.

       logrotate ‐ rotates, compresses, and mails system logs
       logrotate [-dv] [-f|--force] [-s|--state file] config_file ..
       logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rota‐
       tion, compression, removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows
       too large.
       Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job.  It will not modify a log more than once in one day unless the criterion for
       that log is based on the log's size and logrotate is being run more than once each day, or unless the -f or  --force  option
       is used.
       Any  number  of  config files may be given on the command line. Later config files may override the options given in earlier
       files, so the order in which the logrotate config files are listed is important.   Normally,  a  single  config  file  which
       includes  any  other config files which are needed should be used.  See below for more information on how to use the include

       genhomedircon - generate SELinux file context configuration entries for user home directories
       genhomedircon  is  a script that executes semodule to rebuild the currently active SELinux policy (without reloading it) and
       to create the labels for each user home directory based on directory paths returned by calls to getpwent().
       The latter functionality depends on the "usepasswd" parameter being set to "true" (default) in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.
       This script is usually executed by semanage although this default behavior can be optionally modified by setting  to  "true"
       the "disable-genhomedircon" in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

       NetworkManager - network management daemon
       The NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking configuration and operation as painless and automatic as possible by
       managing the primary network connection and other network interfaces, like Ethernet, WiFi, and Mobile Broadband devices.
       NetworkManager will connect any network device when a connection for that device becomes available, unless that behavior is
       disabled. Information about networking is exported via a D-Bus interface to any interested application, providing a rich API
       with which to inspect and control network settings and operation.
DISPATCHER SCRIPTS
       NetworkManager will execute scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d directory or subdirectories in alphabetical
       order in response to network events. Each script should be a regular executable file owned by root. Furthermore, it must not
       be writable by group or other, and not setuid.

       The  multipathd  daemon  is in charge of checking for failed paths. When this happens, it will reconfigure the multipath map
       the path belongs to, so that this map regains its maximum performance and redundancy.
       This daemon executes the external multipath config tool when events occur.  In turn, the multipath tool signals  the  multi‐
       pathd daemon when it is done with devmap reconfiguration, so that it can refresh its failed path list.

       lnstat - unified linux network statistics
       lnstat [options]
       This manual page documents briefly the lnstat command.
       lnstat  is  a  generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodi‐
       cally print a selection of statistical values exported by the kernel.  In addition to routing cache statistics, it  supports
       any kind of statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in /proc/net/stat/.
       Each  file  in  /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column names.  These names are used by lnstat as keys for
       selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line follows which lists the actual  values  for
       each column of the file. lnstat sums these values up (which in fact are counters) before printing them. After each interval,
       only the difference to the last value is printed.

       ausearch - a tool to query audit daemon logs
       ausearch [options]
       ausearch  is  a  tool that can query the audit daemon logs based for events based on different search criteria. The ausearch
       utility can also take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data. Each  commandline  option  given  forms  an
       "and"  statement. For example, searching with -m and -ui means return events that have both the requested type and match the
       user id given. An exception is the -n option; multiple nodes are allowed in a search which will return any matching node.
       It should also be noted that each syscall excursion from user space into the kernel and back into user space has  one  event
       ID that is unique. Any auditable event that is triggered during this trip share this ID so that they may be correlated.
       Different  parts  of  the  kernel  may add supplemental records. For example, an audit event on the syscall "open" will also
       cause the kernel to emit a PATH record with the file name. The ausearch utility will present all records that  make  up  one
       event  together. This could mean that even though you search for a specific kind of record, the resulting events may contain

       wipefs can erase filesystem, raid or partition-table signatures (magic strings) from the specified device to make the signa‐
       tures invisible for libblkid.
       wipefs does not erase the filesystem itself nor any other data from the device.  When used without any options, wipefs lists

       sgdisk - Command-line GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator for Linux and Unix
       sgdisk [ options ] device
       GPT fdisk is a text-mode menu-driven package for creation and manipulation of partition tables. It consists of two programs:
       the text-mode interactive gdisk and the command-line sgdisk. Either program will automatically convert an  old-style  Master
       Boot  Record  (MBR)  partition  table  or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR carrier partition to the newer Globally Unique
       Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID partition  table.  This  man  page  documents  the  com‐
       mand-line sgdisk program.
       Some  advanced data manipulation and recovery options require you to understand the distinctions between the main and backup
       data, as well as between the GPT headers and the partition tables. For information on MBR vs. GPT, as well as GPT  terminol‐
       ogy and structure, see the extended gdisk documentation at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/ or consult Wikipedia.

       This  manual  page documents briefly the mii-diag network adapter control and monitoring command.  Addition documentation is
       available from http://scyld.com/diag/index.html.
       This mii-diag command configures, controls and monitors the transceiver management registers  for  network  interfaces,  and
       configures driver operational parameters.  For transceiver control mii-diag uses the Media Independent Interface (MII) stan‐
       dard (thus the command name).  It also has additional Linux-specific controls to  communicate  parameters  such  as  message
       enable settings and buffer sizes to the underlying device driver.
       The  MII  standard  defines  registers  that  control and report network transceiver capabilities, link settings and errors.
       Examples are link speed, duplex, capabilities advertised to the link partner, status LED indications and  link  error  coun‐
       ters.

       crda
       crda is the Linux wireless central regulatory domain agent.  crda is intended to be used by udev scripts and should not be
       run manually unless debugging udev scripts.  crda is triggered to run by the kernel by sending a udev event upon a new regu‐
       latory domain change. Regulatory domain changes are triggered by the wireless kernel subsystem (upon initialization and on
       reception of country IEs), wireless drivers, or userspace (see iw ). Upon a regulatory domain change the kernel sends a udev
       change event for the regulatory platform. The kernel ignores regulatory domains sent to it if it does not expect them. The
       regulatory domain is read by crda from the regulatory.bin file.
RSA Digital Signature
       If built with openssl or gcrypt support crda will have embedded into it an RSA digital signature which will prevent it from
       reading corrupted or non-authored regulatory.bin files. Authorship is respected by the RSA public key packed into crda.
       This specific crda package has been built with RSA public keys from John Linville (the Linux wireless kernel maintainer) and

       filefrag - report on file fragmentation
       filefrag [ -bblocksize ] [ -BeksvxX ] [ files...  ]
       The filefrag program initially attempts to get the extent information using FIEMAP ioctl which is more efficient and faster.
       If FIEMAP is not supported then filefrag will fall back to using FIBMAP.
       -B     Force the use of the older FIBMAP ioctl instead of the FIEMAP ioctl for testing purposes.

       key.dns_resolver - Upcall for request-key to handle dns_resolver keys
       /sbin/key.dns_resolver <key>
       /sbin/key.dns_resolver -D [-v] [-v] <keydesc> <calloutinfo>
       This program is invoked by request-key on behalf of the kernel when kernel services (such as NFS, CIFS and AFS) want to per‐
       form a hostname lookup and the kernel does not have the key cached.  It is not ordinarily intended to be called directly.
       It can be called in debugging mode to test its functionality by passing a -D flag on the command line.  For  this  to  work,
       the  key  description  and the callout information must be supplied.  Verbosity can be increased by supplying one or more -v
       flags.
ERRORS
       All errors will be logged to the syslog.

       ntfslabel  will  display  or change the file system label on the ntfs file system located on device.  It can also change the
       serial number of the device.
       If the optional argument new-label is not present, and no option is present, ntfslabel will simply display the current  file
       system label.
       If  the  optional  argument  new-label is present, then ntfslabel will set the file system label to be new-label.  NTFS file

       -w     Specifies that the file system should be opened in read-write mode.  Without this option, the file system  is  opened
              in read-only mode.
       -c     Specifies  that  the  file system should be opened in catastrophic mode, in which the inode and group bitmaps are not
              read initially.  This can be useful for filesystems with significant corruption, but because  of  this,  catastrophic
              mode forces the filesystem to be opened read-only.

       This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.
       cifs.upcall is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client filesystem. There are a number of activities that the
       kernel cannot easily do itself. This program is a callout program that does these things for the kernel and then returns the
       result.

       (--unload)] [-e (--exec)] [-t (--type)] [--mem-min=addr] [--mem-max=addr]
       kexec is a system call that enables you to load and boot into another kernel from the currently running kernel.  kexec  per‐
       forms  the  function  of the boot loader from within the kernel. The primary difference between a standard system boot and a
       kexec boot is that the hardware initialization normally performed by the BIOS or firmware (depending on architecture) is not
       performed during a kexec boot. This has the effect of reducing the time required for a reboot.
       Make  sure  you  have  selected CONFIG_KEXEC=y when configuring the kernel. The CONFIG_KEXEC option enables the kexec system
       call.

       quotacheck - scan a filesystem for disk usage, create, check and repair quota files
       quotacheck [ -gubcfinvdMmR ] [ -F quota-format ] -a | filesystem
       quotacheck  examines each filesystem, builds a table of current disk usage, and compares this table against that recorded in
       the disk quota file for the filesystem (this step is omitted  if  option  -c  is  specified).  If  any  inconsistencies  are
       detected,  both the quota file and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only occurs if an
       active filesystem is checked which is not advised).  By default, only user quotas  are  checked.   quotacheck  expects  each
       filesystem  to  be  checked to have quota files named [a]quota.user and [a]quota.group located at the root of the associated
       filesystem.  If a file is not present, quotacheck will create it.
       If the quota file is corrupted, quotacheck tries to save as much data as possible.  Rescuing data may  need  user  interven‐
       tion. With no additional options quotacheck will simply exit in such a situation. When in interactive mode (option -i) , the
       user is asked for advice. Advice can also be provided from command line (see option -n) , which is useful when quotacheck is
       run automatically (ie. from script) and failure is unacceptable.

       pam_console_apply [-f <fstab file>] [-c <console.perms file>] [-r] [-t <tty>] [-s] [-d] [<device file> ...]
       pam_console_apply is a helper executable which sets or resets permissions on device nodes.
       If /var/run/console.lock exists, pam_console_apply will grant permissions to the user listed therein.  If the lock file does
       not exist, permissions are reset according to defaults set in console.perms files, normally configured to set permissions on
       devices so that root owns them.
       When initializing its configuration it first parses the /etc/security/console.perms file and then it searches for files end‐
       ing with the .perms suffix in the /etc/security/console.perms.d directory. These files are parsed in the  lexical  order  in
       "C"  locale.  Permission rules are appended to a global list, console and device class definitions override previous defini‐
       tions of the same class.

       showmount queries the mount daemon on a remote host for information about the state of the NFS server on that machine.  With
       no options showmount lists the set of clients who are mounting from that host.  The output from  showmount  is  designed  to
       appear as though it were processed through ``sort -u''.

     saslauthd — sasl authentication server
     saslauthd -a authmech [-Tvdchlr] [-O option] [-m mux_path] [-n threads] [-s size] [-t timeout]
     saslauthd is a daemon process that handles plaintext authentication requests on behalf of the SASL library.
     The server fulfills two roles: it isolates all code requiring superuser privileges into a single process, and it can be used
     to provide proxy authentication services to clients that do not understand SASL based authentication.
     saslauthd should be started from the system boot scripts when going to multi-user mode. When running against a protected
     authentication database (e.g. the shadow mechanism), it must be run as the superuser. Otherwise it is recommended to run dae‐
     mon unprivileged as saslauth:saslauth. You can do so by following these steps:

       ume[:PE[-PE]...]  [DestinationPhysicalVolume[:PE[-PE]...]...]]
       pvmove allows you to move the allocated physical extents (PEs) on SourcePhysicalVolume to one or more other physical volumes
       (or specified) extents on DestinationPhysicalVolume(s).  If no DestinationPhysicalVolume is specified, the normal allocation
       rules for the Volume Group are used.
       If pvmove gets interrupted for any reason (e.g. the machine crashes) then run pvmove again without any PhysicalVolume  argu‐
       ments  to restart any moves that were in progress from the last checkpoint.  Alternatively use pvmove --abort at any time to
       abort.  The resulting location of logical volumes after an abort is issued depends on whether the --atomic option  was  used
       when starting the pvmove process.

       fsck.fat - check and repair MS-DOS filesystems
       fsck.fat verifies the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems and optionally tries to repair them.
       The following filesystem problems can be corrected (in this order):
       *   FAT contains invalid cluster numbers.  Cluster is changed to EOF.
       *   File's cluster chain contains a loop.  The loop is broken.
       *   Bad  clusters  (read  errors).   The clusters are marked bad and they are removed from files owning them.  This check is

       dnssec-settime - set the key timing metadata for a DNSSEC key
       dnssec-settime [-f] [-K directory] [-L ttl] [-P date/offset] [-A date/offset] [-R date/offset] [-I date/offset]
                      [-D date/offset] [-h] [-V] [-v level] [-E engine] {keyfile}
       dnssec-settime reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the key timing metadata as specified by the -P, -A, -R, -I, and -D
       options. The metadata can then be used by dnssec-signzone or other signing software to determine when a key is to be
       published, whether it should be used for signing a zone, etc.
       If none of these options is set on the command line, then dnssec-settime simply prints the key timing metadata already
       stored in the key.
       When key metadata fields are changed, both files of a key pair (Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key and Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private) are
       regenerated. Metadata fields are stored in the private file. A human-readable description of the metadata is also placed in
       comments in the key file. The private file's permissions are always set to be inaccessible to anyone other than the owner

       htcacheclean [ -D ] [ -v ] [ -t ] [ -Rround ] -ppath url
       htcacheclean is used to keep the size of mod_cache_disk's storage within a given size limit, or limit on inodes in use. This
       tool can run either manually or in daemon mode. When running in daemon mode, it sleeps in  the  background  and  checks  the
       cache  directory at regular intervals for cached content to be removed. You can stop the daemon cleanly by sending it a TERM
       or INT signal. When run manually, a once off check of the cache directory is made for cached content to be removed.  If  one
       or more URLs are specified, each URL will be deleted from the cache, if present.

       getsebool - get SELinux boolean value(s)
       getsebool [-a] [boolean]
       getsebool  reports  where a particular SELinux boolean or all SELinux booleans are on or off In certain situations a boolean
       can be in one state with a pending change to the other state.  getsebool will report this as a pending change.  The  pending
       value indicates the value that will be applied upon the next boolean commit.
       The  setting  of  boolean  values occurs in two stages; first the pending value is changed, then the booleans are committed,
       causing their active values to become their pending values.  This allows a group of booleans  to  be  changed  in  a  single
       transaction, by setting all of their pending values as desired and then committing once.
       -a     Show all SELinux booleans.

       tcpslice - extract pieces of and/or merge together tcpdump files
       tcpslice [ -DdlRrt ] [ -w file ]
                [ start-time [ end-time ] ] file ...
       Tcpslice  is  a  program for extracting portions of packet-trace files generated using tcpdump(l)'s -w flag.  It can also be
       used to merge together several such files, as discussed below.
       The basic operation of tcpslice is to copy to stdout all packets from its input file(s) whose timestamps fall within a given
       range.   The  starting  and  ending times of the range may be specified on the command line.  All ranges are inclusive.  The
       starting time defaults to the earliest time of the first packet in any of the input files; we call this the first time.  The
       ending  time  defaults to ten years after the starting time.  Thus, the command tcpslice trace-file simply copies trace-file
       to stdout (assuming the file does not include more than ten years' worth of data).
       There are a number of ways to specify times.  The first is using Unix timestamps of the form sssssssss.uuuuuu (this  is  the

       Ifconfig  is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.  It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as nec‐
       essary.  After that, it is usually only needed when debugging or when system tuning is needed.
       If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the status of the currently active interfaces.  If a single interface  argument
       is  given,  it  displays the status of the given interface only; if a single -a argument is given, it displays the status of
       all interfaces, even those that are down.  Otherwise, it configures an interface.

       The  logsave program will execute cmd_prog with the specified argument(s), and save a copy of its output to logfile.  If the
       containing directory for logfile does not exist, logsave will accumulate the output in memory until it can be  written  out.
       A copy of the output will also be written to standard output.
       If  cmd_prog  is a single hyphen ('-'), then instead of executing a program, logsave will take its input from standard input
       and save it in logfile
       logsave is useful for saving the output of initial boot scripts until the /var partition is mounted, so the  output  can  be
       written to /var/log.

       Given  a  device or disk-image, partx tries to parse the partition table and list its contents.  It can also tell the kernel
       to add or remove partitions from its bookkeeping.
       The disk argument is optional when a partition argument is provided.  To force scanning a partition as if it  were  a  whole
       disk (for example to list nested subpartitions), use the argument "-" (hyphen-minus).  For example:

       The  Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon implements Apple's Zeroconf architecture (also known as "Rendezvous" or "Bonjour"). The daemon
       registers local IP addresses and static services using mDNS/DNS-SD and provides two IPC APIs for local programs to make  use
       of  the  mDNS  record  cache the avahi-daemon maintains. First there is the so called "simple protocol" which is used exclu‐

       vgimportclone — import and rename duplicated volume group (e.g. a hardware snapshot)
       vgimportclone is used to import a duplicated VG (e.g. hardware snapshot).  Duplicate VG(s) and PV(s) are not able to be used
       until they are made to coexist with the origin VG(s) and PV(s).  vgimportclone renames the VG associated with the  specified
       PV(s) and changes the associated VG and PV UUIDs.
              By default the snapshot VG will be renamed to the original name plus a numeric suffix to avoid duplicate naming (e.g.

       mkfs.fat - create an MS-DOS filesystem under Linux
       mkfs.fat  is  used to create an MS-DOS filesystem under Linux on a device (usually a disk partition).  DEVICE is the special
       file corresponding to the device (e.g. /dev/sdXX).  BLOCK-COUNT is the number of blocks on the device.  If omitted, mkfs.fat
       automatically determines the filesystem size.

           make sure that as long as the partition is properly aligned, so will all the data structures in  the  filesystem.   This

       rpcdebug -vh
       rpcdebug -m module
       rpcdebug -m module -s flags...
       rpcdebug -m module -c flags...
       The rpcdebug command allows an administrator to set and clear the Linux kernel's NFS client and server debug flags.  Setting
       these flags causes the kernel to emit messages to the system log in response to NFS activity; this is typically useful  when
       debugging NFS problems.
       The first form in the synopsis can be used to list all available debug flags.  The second form shows the currently set debug
       flags for the given module.  The third form sets one or more flags, and the fourth form clears one or more flags.
       The value all may be used to set or clear all the flags for the given module.

       These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the configuration (e.g. eth0). They are called with a second  argument
       of "boot" during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be
       ignored at that time.

       fdisk - manipulate disk partition table
       fdisk [options] device
       fdisk -l [device...]
       fdisk  is  a dialog-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables.  It understands GPT, MBR, Sun, SGI and
       BSD partition tables.
       Block devices can be divided into one or more logical disks called partitions.  This division is recorded in  the  partition
       table, usually found in sector 0 of the disk.  (In the BSD world one talks about `disk slices' and a `disklabel'.)
       All  partitioning is driven by device I/O limits (the topology) by default.  fdisk is able to optimize the disk layout for a
       defaults as the default values (e.g. first and last partition sectors) and partition sizes specified by the +<size>{M,G,...}

       client to set each interface's initial configuration prior to requesting an address, to test the address once  it  has  been
       offered, and to set the interface's final configuration once a lease has been acquired.  If no lease is acquired, the script
       is used to test predefined leases, if any, and also called once if no valid lease can be identified.
       This script is not meant to be customized by the end user.  If local customizations are  needed,  they  should  be  possible
       using  the  enter and exit hooks provided (see HOOKS for details).   These hooks will allow the user to override the default
       behaviour of the client in creating a /etc/resolv.conf file, and to handle DHCP options not handled by default.
       No standard client script exists for some operating systems, even though the actual client may work, so  a  pioneering  user
       may  well  need  to create a new script or modify an existing one.  In general, customizations specific to a particular com‐
       puter should be done in the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file.   If you find that you can't make  such  a  customization  without
       customizing /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf or using the enter and exit hooks, please submit a bug report.

       nameif [-c configfile] [-s]
       nameif [-c configfile] [-s] {interface macaddress}
       This program is obsolete. For replacement check ip link.  This functionality is also much better provided by udev methods.
       nameif  renames network interfaces based on mac addresses. When no arguments are given /etc/mactab is read. Each line  of it
       contains an interface name and a Ethernet MAC address. Comments are allowed starting with #.  Otherwise the interfaces spec‐
       ified  on  the  command line are processed.  nameif looks for the interface with the given MAC address and renames it to the
       name given.
       When the -s argument is given all error messages go to the syslog.

       aureport - a tool that produces summary reports of audit daemon logs
       aureport [options]
       aureport  is  a  tool  that produces summary reports of the audit system logs. The aureport utility can also take input from
       stdin as long as the input is the raw log data. The reports have a column label at the top to help  with  interpretation  of
       the various fields. Except for the main summary report, all reports have the audit event number. You can subsequently lookup
       the full event with ausearch -a event number. You may need to specify start & stop times  if  you  get  multiple  hits.  The
       reports produced by aureport can be used as building blocks for more complicated analysis.

       mkntfs  is  used  to  create an NTFS file system on a device (usually a disk partition) or file.  device is the special file
       corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).  number-of-sectors is the number of sectors on the device. If  omitted,  mkntfs
       automagically figures the file system size.
       Below is a summary of all the options that mkntfs accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
       preceded by - and the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be  combined

     rpcbind — universal addresses to RPC program number mapper
     rpcbind [-adhiLls]
     The rpcbind utility is a server that converts RPC program numbers into universal addresses.  It must be running on the host to
     be able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine.
     When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening, and the RPC program numbers it is pre‐
     pared to serve.  When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it first contacts rpcbind on the server
     machine to determine the address where RPC requests should be sent.
     The rpcbind utility should be started before any other RPC service.  Normally, standard RPC servers are started by port moni‐
     tors, so rpcbind must be started before port monitors are invoked.

     There is a hard-coded list of one or more editors that visudo will use set at compile-time that may be overridden via the
     editor sudoers Default variable.  This list defaults to /bin/vi.  Normally, visudo does not honor the VISUAL or EDITOR envi‐
     ronment variables unless they contain an editor in the aforementioned editors list.  However, if visudo is configured with the
     --with-env-editor option or the env_editor Default variable is set in sudoers, visudo will use any the editor defines by

       pppd - Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon
       pppd [ options ]
       PPP  is  the  protocol  used  for  establishing internet links over dial-up modems, DSL connections, and many other types of
       point-to-point links.  The pppd daemon works together with the kernel PPP driver to establish and maintain a PPP  link  with
       another  system (called the peer) and to negotiate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each end of the link.  Pppd can also
       authenticate the peer and/or supply authentication information to the peer.  PPP can be used with  other  network  protocols
       besides IP, but such use is becoming increasingly rare.

       fstrim - discard unused blocks on a mounted filesystem
       fstrim [-a] [-o offset] [-l length] [-m minimum-size] [-v] mountpoint
       fstrim is used on a mounted filesystem to discard (or "trim") blocks which are not in use by the filesystem.  This is useful
       for solid-state drives (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.
       By default, fstrim will discard all unused blocks in the filesystem.  Options may be used to modify this behavior  based  on
       range or size, as explained below.
       The mountpoint argument is the pathname of the directory where the filesystem is mounted.

       sedispatch - setroubleshoot audit dispatcher for SELinux Messages
       sedispatch
       This manual page describes the sedispatch program.
       sedispatch  is  audit  dispatcher.   It  scans audit messages for SELinux AVC messages, formats them into a dbus message and
       sends it to setroubleshootd

       /usr/sbin/exportfs [-v]
       /usr/sbin/exportfs -f
       /usr/sbin/exportfs -s
       An NFS server maintains a table of local physical file systems that are accessible to NFS clients.  Each file system in this
       table is  referred to as an exported file system, or export, for short.
       The exportfs command maintains the current table of exports for the NFS server.  The master export table is kept in  a  file
       named /var/lib/nfs/etab.  This file is read by rpc.mountd when a client sends an NFS MOUNT request.

       dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server.
       dnsmasq [OPTION]...
       dnsmasq  is  a  lightweight  DNS, TFTP, PXE, router advertisement and DHCP server. It is intended to provide coupled DNS and
       DHCP service to a LAN.
       Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local, cache or forwards them to a  real,  recursive,  DNS
       server.  It  loads  the contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved
       and also answers DNS queries for DHCP configured hosts. It can also act as the authoritative DNS  server  for  one  or  more
       domains, allowing local names to appear in the global DNS. It can be configured to do DNSSEC validation.
       The dnsmasq DHCP server supports static address assignments and multiple networks. It automatically sends a sensible default
       set of DHCP options, and can be configured to send any desired set of DHCP options, including  vendor-encapsulated  options.
       It includes a secure, read-only, TFTP server to allow net/PXE boot of DHCP hosts and also supports BOOTP. The PXE support is

       --help] [-V, --version]
       This  daemon  feeds data from a random number generator to the kernel's random number entropy pool, after first checking the
       data to ensure that it is properly random.
       The -f or --foreground options can be used to tell rngd to avoid forking on startup.  This is typically used for  debugging.
       The -b or --background options, which fork and put rngd into the background automatically, are the default.
       The  -r  or --rng-device options can be used to select an alternate source of input, besides the default /dev/hwrandom.  The
       -o or --random-device options can be used to select an alternate entropy output device,  besides  the  default  /dev/random.

       sln - create symbolic links
       sln source dest
       sln filelist
       reason the dynamic linker is not working, sln can be used to make symbolic links to dynamic libraries.
       The command line has two forms.  In the first form, it creates dest as a new symbolic link to source.
       In the second form, filelist is a list of space-separated pathname pairs, and the effect is as if sln was executed once  for
       each line of the file, with the two pathnames as the arguments.
       The sln program supports no command-line options.
%
       mkfs.fat - create an MS-DOS filesystem under Linux
       mkfs.fat  is  used to create an MS-DOS filesystem under Linux on a device (usually a disk partition).  DEVICE is the special
       file corresponding to the device (e.g. /dev/sdXX).  BLOCK-COUNT is the number of blocks on the device.  If omitted, mkfs.fat
       automatically determines the filesystem size.
       -a  Normally,  for  any  filesystem  except very small ones, mkfs.fat will align all the data structures to cluster size, to
           make sure that as long as the partition is properly aligned, so will all the data structures in  the  filesystem.   This
           option  disables alignment; this may provide a handful of additional clusters of storage at the expense of a significant
           performance degradation on RAIDs, flash media or large-sector hard disks.

       pppdump - convert PPP record file to readable format
       pppdump [ -h | -p [ -d ]] [ -r ] [ -m mru ] [ file ...  ]
       The pppdump utility converts the files written using the record option of pppd into a human-readable format.  If one or more
       is written to standard output.
       The options are as follows:
       -h     Prints  the bytes sent and received in hexadecimal.  If neither this option nor the -p option is specified, the bytes
              are printed as the characters themselves, with non-printing and non-ASCII characters printed as escape sequences.
       -p     Collects the bytes sent and received into PPP packets, interpreting the async HDLC framing and escape characters  and
              checking  the  FCS  (frame  check  sequence) of each packet.  The packets are printed as hex values and as characters

       usb_modeswitch - control the mode of 'multi-state' USB devices
       Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard, most of them WWAN and WLAN  dongles. When plugged in
       for the first time, they act like a flash storage and start installing the Windows driver  from  there.  If  the  driver  is
       already installed, it makes the storage device disappear and a new device, mainly composite with modem ports, shows up.
       initially binds to "usb-storage" by default. usb_modeswitch can then send a provided bulk message (most likely a mass  stor‐
       age command) to the device; this message has to be determined by analyzing the actions of the Windows driver.

       lvmetad [-l level[,level...]]  [-p pidfile_path] [-s socket_path] [-t timeout_value] [-f] [-h] [-V] [-?]
       The lvmetad daemon caches LVM metadata, so that LVM commands can read metadata without scanning disks.
       Metadata  caching can be an advantage because scanning disks is time consuming and may interfere with the normal work of the
       system and disks.
       lvmetad does not read metadata from disks itself.  The 'pvscan --cache' command scans disks,  reads  the  LVM  metadata  and
       sends it to lvmetad.
       New LVM disks that appear on the system must be scanned by pvscan before lvmetad knows about them.  If lvmetad does not know
       about a disk, then LVM commands using lvmetad will also not know about it.  When disks are added or removed from the system,
       lvmetad must be updated.

       lnstat - unified linux network statistics
       lnstat [options]
       This manual page documents briefly the lnstat command.
       lnstat  is  a  generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodi‐
       cally print a selection of statistical values exported by the kernel.  In addition to routing cache statistics, it  supports
       any kind of statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in /proc/net/stat/.
       Each  file  in  /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column names.  These names are used by lnstat as keys for
       selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line follows which lists the actual  values  for
       each column of the file. lnstat sums these values up (which in fact are counters) before printing them. After each interval,
       only the difference to the last value is printed.

       tcpdmatch - tcp wrapper oracle
       tcpdmatch [-d] daemon client
       tcpdmatch [-d] daemon[@server] [user@]client
       tcpdmatch predicts how the tcp wrapper would handle a specific request for service.  Examples are given below.
       The  program  examines  the tcpd access control tables (default /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny) and prints its conclu‐
       sion.  For maximal accuracy, it extracts additional information from your inetd or tlid network configuration file.
       When tcpdmatch finds a match in the access control tables, it identifies the matched rule.  In  addition,  it  displays  the
       optional  shell  commands  or  options  in  a  pretty-printed format; this makes it easier for you to spot any discrepancies
       between what you want and what the program understands.

       mkfs.fat - create an MS-DOS filesystem under Linux
       mkfs.fat  is  used to create an MS-DOS filesystem under Linux on a device (usually a disk partition).  DEVICE is the special
       file corresponding to the device (e.g. /dev/sdXX).  BLOCK-COUNT is the number of blocks on the device.  If omitted, mkfs.fat
       automatically determines the filesystem size.
       -a  Normally,  for  any  filesystem  except very small ones, mkfs.fat will align all the data structures to cluster size, to
           make sure that as long as the partition is properly aligned, so will all the data structures in  the  filesystem.   This
           option  disables alignment; this may provide a handful of additional clusters of storage at the expense of a significant
           performance degradation on RAIDs, flash media or large-sector hard disks.

       fping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
       fping [ options ] [ systems... ] fping6 [ options ] [ systems... ]
       fping is a program like ping which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target
       host is responding.  fping differs from ping in that you can specify any number of targets on the command line, or specify a
       file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will
       send out a ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.  In the default mode, if a target replies,
       it is noted and removed from the list of targets to check; if a target does not respond within a certain time limit and/or
       retry limit it is designated as unreachable. fping also supports sending a specified number of pings to a target, or looping
       indefinitely (as in ping ). Unlike ping, fping is meant to be used in scripts, so its output is designed to be easy to
       parse.

       /usr/sbin/sm-notify [-dfn] [-m minutes] [-v name] [-p notify-port] [-P path]
       File locks are not part of persistent file system state.  Lock state is thus lost when a host reboots.
       Network  file  systems  must  also  detect  when lock state is lost because a remote host has rebooted.  After an NFS client
       reboots, an NFS server must release all file locks held by applications that were running on that client.   After  a  server
       reboots, a client must remind the server of file locks held by applications running on that client.

       cryptsetup - manage plain dm-crypt and LUKS encrypted volumes
       cryptsetup <options> <action> <action args>
       cryptsetup  is  used to conveniently setup dm-crypt managed device-mapper mappings. These include plain dm-crypt volumes and
       LUKS volumes. The difference is that LUKS uses a metadata header and can hence offer more features than plain  dm-crypt.  On
       the other hand, the header is visible and vulnerable to damage.
       In  addition,  cryptsetup provides limited support for the use of historic loopaes volumes and for TrueCrypt compatible vol‐
       umes.
PLAIN DM-CRYPT OR LUKS?
       Unless you understand the cryptographic background well, use LUKS.  With plain dm-crypt there are a number of possible  user
       errors that massively decrease security. While LUKS cannot fix them all, it can lessen the impact for many of them.

       dnssec-keyfromlabel generates a key pair of files that referencing a key object stored in a cryptographic hardware service
       module (HSM). The private key file can be used for DNSSEC signing of zone data as if it were a conventional signing key
       created by dnssec-keygen, but the key material is stored within the HSM, and the actual signing takes place there.
       The name of the key is specified on the command line. This must match the name of the zone for which the key is being
       generated.

       vgcfgbackup — backup volume group descriptor area
       vgcfgbackup allows you to backup the metadata of your volume groups.  If you don't name any volume  groups  on  the  command

       In a default installation, each volume group gets backed up into a separate file bearing the name of the volume group in the
       more than one volume group the filename is treated as a template, and %s gets replaced by the volume group name.

       cgdisk - Curses-based GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
       cgdisk [ -a ] device
       GPT  fdisk  is  a  text-mode family of programs for creation and manipulation of partition tables. The cgdisk member of this
       family employs a curses-based user interface for interaction using a text-mode menuing system. It will automatically convert
       an  old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR carrier partition to the newer
       Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID partition table. Other members  of  this
       program  family  are  gdisk (the most feature-rich program of the group, with a non-curses-based interactive user interface)
       and sgdisk (which is driven via command-line options for use by experts or in scripts).  FixParts is a related  program  for
       fixing a limited set of problems with MBR disks.
       For  information  on  MBR  vs.  GPT,  as  well as GPT terminology and structure, see the extended GPT fdisk documentation at

       lvremove — remove a logical volume
       lvremove removes one or more logical volumes.  Confirmation will be requested before deactivating any active logical  volume
       prior  to  removal.   Logical  volumes  cannot be deactivated or removed while they are open (e.g. if they contain a mounted
       filesystem).  Removing an origin logical volume will also remove all dependent snapshots.
       If the logical volume is clustered then it must be deactivated on all nodes in the cluster before it can be removed. A  sin‐
       gle lvchange command issued from one node can do this.
       If  the  configuration setting metadata/record_lvs_history is enabled and the logical volume being removed forms part of the
       history of at least one logical volume that is still present then a simplified representation of the logical volume will  be
       retained.   This includes the time of removal (lv_time_removed reporting field), creation time (lv_time), name (lv_name), LV

       provided.
       If  --test  action  is  specified,  the  authconfig just reads the current settings from the various configuration files and
       prints their values.  If --update action is specified, authconfig must be run by root (or through console helper), and  con‐
       figuration  changes  are saved. Only the files affected by the configuration changes are overwritten.  If --updateall action
       is specified, authconfig must be run by root (or through console helper), and all  configuration  files  are  written.   The
       --probe  action  instructs authconfig to use DNS and other means to guess at configuration information for the current host,

       runuser - run a command with substitute user and group ID
       runuser [options] -u user command [argument...]
       runuser [options] [-] [user [argument...]]
       runuser allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.  If the option -u is not given, it falls back to su-com‐
       patible semantics and a shell is executed.  The difference between the commands runuser and su is that runuser does not  ask
       for  a  password  (because it may be executed by the root user only) and it uses a different PAM configuration.  The command
       runuser does not have to be installed with suid permissions.
       When called without arguments, runuser defaults to running an interactive shell as root.
       For backward compatibility, runuser defaults to not change the current directory and to only set the  environment  variables

       blkmapd - pNFS block layout mapping daemon
       blkmapd [-h] [-d] [-f]
       The  pNFS  block  layout protocol builds a complex storage hierarchy from a set of simple volumes.  These simple volumes are
       addressed by content, using a signature on the volume to uniquely name each one.  The daemon locates a volume  by  examining
       each block device in the system for the given signature.
       The  topology typically consists of a hierarchy of volumes built by striping, slicing, and concatenating the simple volumes.
       The blkmapd daemon uses the device-mapper driver to construct logical devices that reflect the server topology,  and  passes
       these devices to the kernel for use by the pNFS block layout client.

       ntfsundelete has three modes of operation: scan, undelete and copy.
   Scan
       The  default  mode,  scan simply reads an NTFS Volume and looks for files that have been deleted.  Then it will print a list
       giving the inode number, name and size.
   Undelete
       The undelete mode takes the files either matching the regular expression (option -m) or  specified by the  inode-expressions
       and  recovers  as  much  of  the data as possible.   It saves the result to another location.  Partly for safety, but mostly
       because NTFS write support isn't finished.

                          [--mode] [--protocol] [--channel]
       iwgetid  is used to find out the NWID, ESSID or AP/Cell Address of the wireless network that is currently used. The informa‐
       tion reported is the same as the one shown by iwconfig, but iwgetid is easier to integrate in various scripts.
       By default, iwgetid will print the ESSID of the device, and if the device doesn't have any ESSID it will print its NWID.
       The default formatting output is pretty-print.
       --raw  This option disables pretty-printing of the information. This option is  orthogonal  to  the  other  options  (except
              --scheme), so with the appropriate combination of options you can print the raw ESSID, AP Address or Mode.
              This  format is ideal when storing the result of iwgetid as a variable in Shell or Perl scripts or to pass the result
              as an argument on the command line of iwconfig.

       runlevel - Print previous and current SysV runlevel
       runlevel [options...]
       "Runlevels" are an obsolete way to start and stop groups of services used in SysV init. systemd provides a compatibility
       layer that maps runlevels to targets, and associated binaries like runlevel. Nevertheless, only one runlevel can be "active"
       at a given time, while systemd can activate multiple targets concurrently, so the mapping to runlevels is confusing and only
       approximate. Runlevels should not be used in new code, and are mostly useful as a shorthand way to refer the matching
       systemd targets in kernel boot parameters.

       arp-fingerprint - Fingerprint a system using ARP
       arp-fingerprint [options] target
       The  target  should  be  specified  as a single IP address or hostname.  You cannot specify multiple targets, IP networks or
       ranges.
       If you use an IP address for the target, you can use the -o option to pass the --numeric option to arp-scan, which will pre‐
       vent  it  from  attempting  DNS lookups.  This can speed up the fingerprinting process, especially on systems with a slow or
       faulty DNS configuration.

       have the proper format and contain valid data. The user is prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted or which
       have other uncorrectable errors.
       Checks are made to verify that each entry has:

       File locks are not part of persistent file system state.  Lock state is thus lost when a host reboots.
       Network  file  systems  must  also  detect  when lock state is lost because a remote host has rebooted.  After an NFS client
       reboots, an NFS server must release all file locks held by applications that were running on that client.   After  a  server
       reboots, a client must remind the server of file locks held by applications running on that client.

       gdisk - Interactive GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
       gdisk [ -l ] device
       GPT fdisk (aka gdisk) is a text-mode menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables. It will automat‐
       ically convert an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR  carrier  parti‐
       tion  to the newer Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID partition table. When
       used with the -l command-line option, the program displays the current partition table and then exits.
       GPT fdisk operates mainly on the GPT headers and partition tables; however, it can and will generate a fresh protective MBR,
       when  required.  (Any boot loader code in the protective MBR will not be disturbed.) If you've created an unusual protective
       MBR, such as a hybrid MBR created by gptsync or gdisk's own hybrid MBR creation feature, this should  not  be  disturbed  by
       most  ordinary  actions. Some advanced data recovery options require you to understand the distinctions between the main and
       backup data, as well as between the GPT headers and the partition tables. For information on MBR vs. GPT,  as  well  as  GPT
       terminology and structure, see the extended gdisk documentation at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/ or consult Wikipedia.

       pppoe-status is a shell script which checks the status of the PPPoE link established by the Roaring Penguin user-space PPPoE
       client.  If you omit config_file, the default file /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf is used.
       pppoe-status was written by Dianne Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>.

       fipvlan - Fibre Channel over Ethernet VLAN Discovery
       fipvlan -h|--help
       fipvlan -v|--version
       The  fipvlan  command performs Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) Initialization Protocol (FIP) VLAN Discovery over Ethernet
       interfaces. fipvlan can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine which VLANs have FCoE services  available  on  a  network,
       prior to configuring VLAN interfaces and the Open-FCoE initiator. fipvlan can also be used to create VLAN interfaces as they
       are discovered, and to start the Open-FCoE initiator. The --create and --start options are primarily intended to be used  as
       part of an Open-FCoE boot solution. FCoE instances started in this way cannot be destroyed or reset by fcoeadm.

       system located on device.  If the filesystem is mounted, it can be used to expand the size of the mounted filesystem, assum‐
       ture enabled.)
       The  size  parameter  specifies  the requested new size of the filesystem.  If no units are specified, the units of the size
       parameter shall be the filesystem blocksize of the filesystem.  Optionally, the size parameter may be suffixed by one of the
       tively.  The size of the filesystem may never be larger than the size of the partition.  If size parameter is not specified,
       it will default to the size of the partition.

       mkfs.cramfs - make compressed ROM file system
       mkfs.cramfs [options] directory file
       Files  on  cramfs file systems are zlib-compressed one page at a time to allow random read access.  The metadata is not com‐
       pressed, but is expressed in a terse representation that is more space-efficient than conventional file systems.
       The file system is intentionally read-only to simplify its design; random write access for compressed files is difficult  to
       implement.  cramfs ships with a utility (mkcramfs) to pack files into new cramfs images.
       but can extend past it.)
