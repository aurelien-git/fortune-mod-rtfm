1. "If there are other people using your computer, you may be worried that someone else may accidentally access, modify, and/or delete your files. Most operating systems (including Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X, and Linux) give you the option of creating a different user account for each user, and you can set the amount of access and privileges for each account. You may also choose to have separate accounts for your work and personal purposes. While this approach will not completely isolate each area, it does offer some additional protection. However, it will not protect your computer against vulnerabilities that give an attacker administrative privileges. Ideally, you will have separate computers for work and personal use; this will offer a different type of protection." - United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Twitter: @uscert_gov

3. "Practice the principle of least privilege. Do not log into a computer with administrator rights unless you must do so to perform specific tasks. Running your computer as an administrator (or as a Power User in Windows) leaves your computer vulnerable to security risks and exploits. Simply visiting an unfamiliar Internet site with these high-privilege accounts can cause extreme damage to your computer, such as reformatting your hard drive, deleting all your files, and creating a new user account with administrative access." - Indiana University (Best practices for computer security) Twitter: @insideUITS

5. "Your computer operating system may allow other computers on a network, including the Internet, to access the hard-drive of your computer in order to “share files”. This ability to share files can be used to infect your computer with a virus or look at the files on your computer if you don’t pay close attention. So, unless you really need this ability, make sure you turn off file-sharing. Check your operating system and your other program help files to learn how to disable file sharing. Don’t share access to your computer with strangers!" - CyberSmart.org (Internet Safety Tips for Elementary and Middle School Students, Educators and Families)

6. "The biggest mistake any hardware user can make is to ignore backing up their data. Software can be reinstalled; data lost is irreplaceable. We are in a digital age and a lot of our data is stored digitally – bank records, photos, letters, music. A recent NCSA/Symantec study showed that over 68% of Americans store more than 25% of their photos digitally, for example. There are any number of ways data can be lost. Accidental deletion is common. Device failure happens. Natural events, such as electrical or wind storms, fires, or floods can eradicate data. Cyber events such as viruses, spyware or other cyber attacks can remove data, as well." - SafetyWeb (Cyber Security Tips)

Email Security Quotes
%
26. "Microsoft never sends out patches or updates by email. There are no exceptions. Keep that in mind and you won't be a victim of a Microsoft patch hoax. The first time I received one of these, I sat down at my workstation and saw an email message from Microsoft telling me to install the patch they had handily supplied as an attachment. I knew this was bogus immediately. We sent out a voicemail quickly warning all employees not to fall for opening attachments that offer to install any kind of software. That was March, 1999. Every 18 months or so, someone tries this hoax again by crafting and sending out a phony email complete with a Microsoft look-alike logo, spoofed return address, links, etc., and some text assuring you that this is all the real thing. It isn't." - SANS Security Awareness Tip of the Day Twitter: @SANSInstitute
%
27. "Be suspicious of any unexpected email attachments even if they appear to be from someone you know. A simple rule of thumb is that if you don't know the person who is sending you an email, be very careful about opening the email and any file attached to it. Should you receive a suspicious email, the best thing to do is to delete the entire message, including any attachment." - KPBSD Connections

28. "Never send your credit card number, Social Security number, bank account number, driver's license number, or similar details in an email, which is generally not secure. Think of email as a paper postcard — people can see what's written on it if they try hard enough. Be suspicious of any company that asks for this type of information in an email or instant message. Most legitimate companies will never ask you to confirm sensitive data in an online form or in an email; instead, they'll use postal mail to request this information." - Yahoo Safety Center (How can I prevent identity theft?) Twitter: @Yahoo
%
29. "One of the first things that I recommend checking in a suspicious email message is the integrity of any embedded URLs. Often times the URL in a phishing message will appear to be perfectly valid. However, if you hover your mouse over top of the URL, you will see the actual hyperlinked address (at least that’s how it works in Outlook). If the hyperlinked address is different from the address that is displayed, then the message is probably fraudulent or malicious." - Brien Posey, TechRepublic (10 Tips for Spotting a Phishing Email) Twitter: @TechRepublic

Password Security
%
35. "A password manager is a secure storage location for all your different passwords. It integrates with your web browser and automatically enters your username and password for you when you are logging in to a website. A good password manager will also generate secure passwords for you when you register with a new site or change a password. The password manager protects its contents by using a special “master” password. Needless to say, it is critical to choose a very strong master password. Some password managers allow you to add multi-factor authentication in addition to your master password to give you an extra layer of security. There are plenty of good password managers to choose from (far too many to mention here) and many of them are free. I often recommend LastPass, KeePass or Password Safe." - Dave Herrald, GTRI (Five Cyber Security Tips for Computer and Online Safety) Twitter: @GTRI_Global

All a user needs to do is remember the password for actually getting into the application, like 1Password or Password Manager, and he or she has full access to important accounts. Such password managers are important: They act as a repository for credentials, they create strong passwords, and they can populate password fields whenever the user goes to a particular site. Definitely check them out." - Don Reisinger, eWeek (Securing Sensitive Personal Data in Cloud Services: 10 Best Practices) Twitter: @eWEEKNews

39. "Rather than lecture you yet again on why you should use good passwords, let me suggest that you use easy-to-remember, but hard to crack passwords that use phrases rather than random characters. So, for example, 'Steelers?Win!Cowboys?Lose!' or 'Volt!Amp!Tesla!Edison?' won't be cracked by any common password cracker program but you'll be able to recall such phrases much more easily than say 'ufc#1310.' Safe passwords don't have to be memory twisters. They just have to be hard for computers to work out, and phrases make great passwords." - Steven J.

These scams are sometimes also called phishing and baiting, as well as click-jacking. Whatever they’re called, just know that not every post on social media is safe to click on. You should take special care to treat every link with suspicion, especially those that look like click bait." - Rick Delgado for the National Edition, Tech Cocktail (The Biggest Security Concerns with Social Media You Need to Know) Twitter: @TechCocktail

Phishing attacks -- like the one that may have been behind the recent Twitter AP hoax -- will persist because they work. Social engineering scams will grow more creative in their efforts to con people into coughing up bank account info, network credentials and other sensitive data. And social sites -- all of which are predicated upon words like sharing and connecting -- will be a prime breeding group for such activity, even with tighter perimeter defenses such as two-factor authentication.

64. "Malware is defined as computer virus software that spreads through malicious programs. Malware is short for 'malicious software' and can commonly be referred to as a 'computer virus.' Malware viruses includes worms, Trojans and other software created to conduct malicious activity. Malware usually appears in the form of a useful program that is available for download from a genuine-looking company website, email or pop-up advertisement. The malware program is written into the program and can cause harm to the user's computer, as well as monitor computer use and copy sensitive data." - Kaspersky Lab (Essential Malware Protection Advice for Families) Twitter: @kaspersky

65. "Although there is no guarantee that you’ll always be free from spyware, there are some things you can do to seriously lower your risk. First and foremost, you need to use an anti-spyware program that detects and prevents spyware from installing itself on your computer (and removes it). Anti-spyware software can also periodically scan your computer for spyware that may get through and remove it." - SchoolCounselor.com

66. "Thieves gather SSNs in many ways, from the high-tech – e.g., hacking, phishing, malware, spyware, and keystroke loggers – to the low-tech – e.g., dumpster diving, stealing workplace records, stealing mail or wallets, and accessing public records containing SSNs. What is not known, however, is the prevalence of each of these methods. This is due in large part to the fact that victims frequently do not know how their information was compromised. Moreover, even if reliable prevalence data were available, it likely would become outdated quickly as identity thieves change techniques to harvest consumers’ data." - FTC. gov (Security in Numbers: SSNs and ID Theft) Twitter: @FTC

Security on the Social Web and in the Cloud

What exactly is the cloud? It is basically the collection of computers on the internet that companies are using to offer their services.
%
84. "What exactly is the cloud? It is basically the collection of computers on the internet that companies are using to offer their services. One cloud service that is being offered is a revolutionary storage method for your data. From music files to pictures to sensitive documents, the cloud invisibly backs up your files and folders and alleviates the potentially endless and costly search for extra storage space. An alternative to buying an external hard drive or deleting old files to make room for new ones, cloud storage is convenient and cost-effective. It works by storing your files on a server out in the internet somewhere rather than on your local hard drive... This allows you to back up, sync, and access your data across multiple devices as long as they have internet capability." - Boston University Information Security (How to Safely Store your Data in the Cloud) Twitter: @BU_Tweets

You are using the cloud when you do online banking. You're using the cloud when you store something in a Dropbox account. And you're even using the cloud when you're watching Netflix because Netflix outsources its data storage to Amazon's Web Services, which is a cloud-computing provider." -Nichole Perlroth, technology reporter for The New York Times, as quoted by Michael Martin for NPR (Clouds Are Convenient, But Be Paranoid To Protect Personal Data) Twitter: @nprnews

(Please refer to ITRC Fact Sheet FS 120B – A Guide for Parents – Child Identity Theft Indicators.) A quick check of credit reports will help you sort out the truth. Currently, all three reporting agencies use automated systems for ordering credit reports. You should contact them directly and request a credit report for your child.

Agent Smith: I’d like to share a revelation that I’ve had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realised that you’re not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we... are the cure.

Agent Smith: Can you hear me, Morpheus? I’m going to be honest with you. I... hate this place, this zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it. I can’t stand it any longer. It’s the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink. And every time I do I fear that I have somehow been infected by it. It’s repulsive, isn’t it? I must get out of here. I must get free and in this mind is the key, my key. Once Zion is destroyed there is no need for me to be here, do you understand? I need the codes.

Agent Smith: Our connection. I don’t fully understand how it happened, perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied, it is at this point irrelevant. What matters is whatever happened, happened for a reason.

Neo: And what reason is that?

Agent Smith: I killed you, Mr. Anderson, I watched you die. With a certain satisfaction, I might add. And then something happened. Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn’t. I couldn’t. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson. Because of you, I am no longer an Agent of this system. Because of you I’ve changed, I’m unplugged, a new man, so to speak. Like you, apparently, free.

Neo: Congratulations.

Agent Smith: Thank you. But, as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we’re here. We’re not here because we’re free, we’re here because we’re not free. There is no escaping reason, no denying purpose, because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.

Multiple Smiths: It is purpose that created us. Purpose that connects us. Purpose that pulls us, that guides us, that drives us. It is purpose that defines, purpose that binds us.

Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson! You must know it by now! You can’t win! It’s pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson? Why?! Why do you persist?!
